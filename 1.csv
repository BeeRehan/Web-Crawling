The deceased was identified as Zafor Alam, 30, of Nayapara village under Sabrang union, our Cox's Bazar correspondent reports, quoting a BGB official.



BGB members challenged a boat that came from Myanmar by crossing the Naf river and tried to get ashore at Gholarchar ghat, said Lt Colonel Mohammad Faysal Hasan Khan, commanding officer (CO) of BGB Battalion-2 in Teknaf.



However, the people on board fired shots at the border guards, forcing the BGB members to retaliate, triggering a gunfight at the river bank at Shahparirdwip area at around 2:00am, said the CO.



They found an injured person on the spot while the rest managed to flee the scene at one stage of the gunfight, he added.



He was rushed to Teknaf Upazila Health Complex, where doctors declared him dead, the BGB official said.



BGB recovered two lakh yaba pills worth around Tk six crore and a locally made gun from the boat after the incident, said Faysal.



The body was later sent to Cox's Bazar General Hospital for autopsy while BGB filed a case in this regard, he added.

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/the-watermelon-divers-kirtankhola-1894345,2020-04-19 00:00:00+06:00,The watermelon divers of Kirtankhola,"Like the kingfisher dive-bombs into rivers to prey on small fish, these boys plunge into the Kirtankhola to collect stray watermelons every day of the season.

Flowing from the west bank of Barishal city, Kirtankhola plays host to watermelon traders from all around the region. Every day, hundreds of trawlers from Bhola, Patuakhali, and Barguna anchor at Port Road's watermelon trade hub.

The trawlers are filled to the brim before they set sail, and it's almost expected that a few of the green-goodness will be lost to the river. This is where our boys come in.

Jasim (12) and Ibrahim (10) are siblings from nearby Rasulpur slum area. They go to a local primary school, to fifth and fourth grades respectively. Their father is a daywage worker and mother works as a house help.

During watermelon season, the boys get to work at noon. Like other children of the Rasulpur slum, the brothers know how to swim, and they're not afraid to take on the waves. They get on their styrofoam rafts and pick-up stray watermelons, even if they are floating in the middle of the river. They have done this for so long that they might have really developed kingfisher like scoping abilities -- they say nothing escapes their eyes!

Although the coronavirus shutdown is negatively affecting almost everyone else's lives, for the boys, the leisure is but an opportunity to grab even more.

Watermelon is a big fruit, so any number they get is a good number. Once they feel like they have enough, they bring it home and share with the family. For a cash-strapped family like theirs, delicacies are hard to come by, and so these melons bring a lot of extra happiness.

In fact, it's not just watermelons. When the melons are out of stock, the boys collect everything from coconuts, lime, betel gourd, pumpkin, guava, lemon. Basically any and everything that plies the river and drops into it.

The river is like a companion to the children who grow up in Rasulpur, the Barishal City Corporation councillor of the area said. So much so, that some of them harbour dreams to spend the rest of their lives with it. Like Jasim, who said he wants to grow up to be a ""pilot"" of a passenger launch.

""I like the river. If I get to become a pilot, my family can live in more comfort, and we won't have to pick-up watermelons from the river.""

But wait, does this mean he doesn't like doing this? Turns out, that's not the case at all.

""No, no, that's not to say I don't like this. It is my pleasure to dive for watermelons and all the other fruits and vegetables. It has become something of a hobby and it brings me a lot of joy,"" Jasim corrected himself with a smile."

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/rhino-1894036,2020-04-18 00:00:00+06:00,Rhino,"Last week I wrote about the book African Silences by Peter Matthiessen recounting a series of trips he made in Africa in search of birds and wildlife. Along with other animals, the book taught me about the White Rhino.

Among all land mammals in the world, the rhino is second only to the elephant in size. There are five species of rhinos in the world. They are White Rhino, Black Rhino, One-horned Rhino, Javan Rhino and Sumatran Rhino. The White Rhino is the largest, weighing in at around 6000 pounds. (In comparison, the African Elephant weighs up to 15000 pounds.) Rhinos are herbivores, living on grass and leaves. Although large, they are fast and can exceed 30 miles/hour during a charge. They are clad in a thick, protective skin up to 2 inches thick. Man is their only predator; they are killed for their horns used for medicinal purpose. Their name comes from their unique appearance: ""Rhinoceros"" is derived from a Greek word meaning ""nose-horned.""

Matthiessen observes that the White Rhino had two subspecies: Northern White Rhino and Southern White Rhino. The Northern subspecies has become extinct, largely due to wholesale slaughter by humans. For example, in the years following the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Simba rebels slaughtered 90% of the White Rhinos there for the purpose of selling their horns. The proceeds were used to buy more weapons. Subsequent efforts to save the subspecies came to naught.

The Southern White Rhino can be easily seen in South Africa.

The moniker ""White"" is a misnomer – the animals are not really white. It apparently comes from the word ""weit"", an Afrikaner word meaning ""wide"", called so because of their wide mouths. English settlers misheard the name.

The Black Rhino (not really black, but named as a counterpoint to the White Rhino!) is found in Kenya, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. I saw it in Kenya's Lake Nakuru National park which has the world's largest concentration of them: one hundred and fifty. In the early morning light two rhinos were grazing in a meadow. At one point they faced each other and nuzzled their large horns. It was touching to see the show of affection among these two giants.

The Javan Rhino is the rarest rhino, critically endangered, with around seventy-two left in the wild. They are the smallest of the rhinos but still formidable at 3000-5000 pounds. All surviving members live in Ujong Kulon National Park in Java.

The Sumatran Rhino is also critically endangered. It is estimated that less than a hundred live in the wild.

One rhino differs in appearance than all the others. While the rest have two horns, the Greater One Horned Rhino, living in India and Nepal, sports just one. Its story is in stark contrast to the Northern White Rhino. Once close to extinction, efforts to save it succeeded and today it numbers over three thousand, the majority in Kaziranga and Chitwan parks in India and Nepal respectively.

In Bangladesh, there are records of rhinos from the late 1880s and early 1900s. For example, Sundarban was home to a subspecies of the Javan Rhino. However, this subspecies, Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis, has become extinct. At other times Bangladesh also had the Greater One-horned Rhino and the Sumatran Rhino.

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/help-us-get-home-1893628,2020-04-17 00:00:00+06:00,‘Help us get home’: Over 150 Bangladeshis stranded in Australia appeal for repatriation,"Sweety Dhar, in her mid-30s, is a cancer patient and has been in Australia for treatment since September last year.

""I finished my chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery recently. It's been a long and tough journey. My flight was booked on April 3 but it was cancelled, and the airline has not refunded me yet,"" Sweety said.

""My little girl cries for me everyday. I am desperately waiting to go back home"" she told this correspondent helplessly.

She is one of the 150-plus Bangladeshis -- including tourists, students and temporary residents -- who have been stranded in Australia, made an appeal to the government to come back home.

The Australian government has already advised all temporary visa holders -- like students unable to support themselves and those on visitor visas lasting three months or less, to return to their home country as quickly as possible.

In such a situation, many students and temporary residents fell into financial hardships after losing jobs, while tourists are already in cash crunch.

The Bangladesh High Commission in Australia said they uploaded a needs assessment template on its website where persons of Bangladeshi origin in need in Australia are requested to register.

""As of now, 213 people have registered among which 159 would like to travel back to Bangladesh,"" Mohammad Sufiur Rahman, high commissioner for Bangladesh to Australia, told The Daily Star on Tuesday.

The applicants include government employees, bankers, doctors and teachers, and those who came for cancer treatment or to attend conference.

Syeeda Nafisa, a physician by profession, came to Australia as a visitor and has been stuck for the last one month. ""I need to go back to my country to serve at this time of national crisis, since my hospital is already running short of doctors,"" she said.

Masrur Mahmood Shuvo, an employee of a private bank in Bangladesh, has been stuck in Australia after going on a trip with his spouse and daughter. Talking to this correspondent, he said if they fail to find an arrangement, they will have to be stranded there for next six months without income and limited access to funds. Many will have expired passports and visas, he said.

""Under these circumstances, we would request to the authorities to arrange a return flight for us. In case we can arrange a flight, we would need all cooperation from the high commission, the foreign ministry and the aviation ministry to accept our landing proposals and formalities,"" Masrur said.

Meanwhile, most Bangladeshi students there have their job hours slashed, while some even lost their jobs. Nearly half of them are from Victoria, while some are in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.

Mohammad Taukir Muzib, a law student at Swinburne University in Melbourne, said he lost his job and his funds are depleting. ""With this fund, I might be able survive for a month,"" said Taukir. ""Our families in Bangladesh are also worried.""

There are about six thousand Bangladeshi students in Australia, who have to pay USD 16,000 to 20,000 per semester. With the coronavirus forcing a situation of urgency in Bangladesh, many of them are not getting financial help from their families.

In a reply to an email, the Bangladesh high commissioner said they are fully aware of the difficulties Bangladeshis in Australia are facing due to the Covid-19 situation and their officials are in touch with members of the community

""We have made our recommendations to Dhaka. Those include connectivity via Hong Kong or Guangzhou and arrangement of special flights for return. As of now, Bangladesh has not decided to open such flights. We are awaiting a decision,"" he said.

He said they are also working with social, cultural and professional bodies to support Bangladeshis in distress. ""A pool of Bangladeshi doctors [for informal consultation] have been set up for supporting members of our diaspora in Australia.""

""Additionally, the high commission has formally engaged Australian authorities to reduce tuition and ancillary fees for our students. Many universities are responding positively and have written back to us,"" he added."

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/2yrs-rajibs-death-neither-justice-nor-compensation-1893631,2020-04-17 00:00:00+06:00,"2yrs of Rajib’s Death: Neither justice, nor compensation","It has been exactly two years since college student Rajib Hossain died after losing a hand that got stuck between two buses racing in the city, but his family has neither got justice nor any compensation yet.

Investigation officer of the case in December last year submitted charge sheet to a Dhaka Court ""secretly"" under section 304 (B) of Bangladesh Penal Code, which grants imprisonment for three years if proven guilty, although a probe report earlier found that unholy competition between the buses led to his death.

The family filed a no-confidence petition against the charge sheet as they believe the drivers of the two buses -- BRTC and Sajan Paribahan -- should get life sentences.

While they are waiting for hearing of the petition, the drivers -- who were arrested -- recently came out on bail.

Besides, the family is yet to get Tk 50 lakh as compensation, as per a High Court verdict. The matter was stalled as bus authorities filed two separate leave-to-appeal petitions with the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court verdict. The SC is yet to set any date for hearing the appeals.

""It was a murder. Rajib was killed due to the competition of the two buses… But we are in doubt of getting justice as the investigation officer did not submit charge sheet properly,"" Jahanara Begum, aunt of Rajib, told The Daily Star yesterday.

Sub-inspector Idris Ali of Shahbagh Police Station submitted the charge sheet to a Dhaka Court on December 22 last year where he mentioned that he shared his findings with victim's family.

But Jahanara said they came to know about the charge sheet submission in February this year.

Jahanara said their no-confidence petition was scheduled for hearing on April 1 but did not due to the closure of courts following the coronavirus outbreak.

The right hand of Rajib, a third-year student at Titumir Government College in the capital, got stuck between two speeding buses in Karwan Bazar. After being in coma for two weeks, Rajib died on April 17, 2018.

Family members said Rajib and his two brothers were orphaned at an early age. He used to support his brothers with earnings form a part-time job and private tuition. Rajib's brothers Mehedi Hasan Bappi -- a ninth grader -- and Abdulla Hridoy -- an eighth grader -- stay at a hostel of a madrasa in Mir Hazirbagh of Jatrabari.

The family is concerned about their future and believe they would get a little relief if they get the compensation.

Following a writ petition, the High Court on May 8, 2018, ordered the bus companies to pay Tk 1 crore to Rajib's family. BRTC and Sajan Paribahan challenged the HC order and the Supreme Court on May 22 last year stayed the order and asked the HC to form an independent committee to assess the liabilities.

The committee, led by Prof Mizanur Rahman, director of Accident Research Institute at Buet, in its report submitted to the court said reckless driving was the ""primary cause of the accident"".

The report pointed out that the heavy vehicles were being illegally driven by drivers with licences to drive light vehicles.

On October 25 last year, The HC in its full verdict asked BRTC and Sajan Paribahan owners to pay in two months Tk 25 lakh each to Rajib's brothers.

Both BRTC and Sajan authorities later filed leave-to-appeals with the SC. The SC is yet to set any date for hearing on the appeals, BRTC lawyer Barrister Moniruzzaman told The Daily Star.

In the verdict, the HC directed authorities concerned to bring bus services in all metropolitan cities under the franchising system, and said trip-based or daily payment based appointment of public bus drivers should be banned; a company should recruit them with monthly salaries. The court also ordered authorities concerned to run vision and drug tests at the time of granting and renewing licences for drivers of all vehicles.

However, the scenario on the roads -- at least up till the countrywide closure of public transportation late last month -- has not shown any considerable change."

Acting on a tip-off, the coast guard patrol launched a three-day search for the boat, locating it at night off the country's southeastern coast, spokesman Lieutenant Shah Zia Rahman said.

""We have rescued at least 382 Rohingya from a big overcrowded fishing trawler and brought them to a beach near [the coastal town of] Teknaf. They were starving,"" Rahman told AFP, adding that more than 30 had died on board.

""They were floating for 58 days. And over the last seven days it was moving in our territorial waters,"" he said.

The Rohingya, who were thought to be from refugee camps on Bangladesh's southeast coast, were headed to Malaysia, but turned back at sea when that country implemented a strict coastal patrol due to the coronavirus pandemic, a local newspaper said.

Rahman said authorities would investigate the possibility that the refugees could also have come from the Rohingya homeland in Myanmar's restive Rakhine state, where they are a persecuted Muslim minority.

Those rescued reported that ""32 Rohingya died aboard the overcrowded trawler and their bodies were thrown in the sea,"" the official said, adding that an investigation into the matter was under way.

""We have cordoned off the place where they have landed. We could not question them because of the fear they could be infected with the coronavirus,"" he said.

Footage posted on Facebook by a local journalist showed mostly women and children, emaciated and standing on the beach.

A local government administrator told AFP that officials were still counting the rescued but that he feared the number could exceed 400.

Nearly one million Rohingya live in squalid camps near Bangladesh's border with Myanmar, many fleeing the neighboring country after a brutal military crackdown began in 2017.

With few opportunities for jobs and education in the camps, thousands have attempted to reach other countries like Malaysia and Thailand.

Since late last year, Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies have picked up some 1,000 Rohingya from coastal villages and boats as they waited to board vessels bound for Malaysia."

The extent of the brutality was such that Hosne Akhter, an NGO trainer, was buried alive after being killed by bayonet charging. Only her son Saidur Rahman and two daughters Dilruba Khatun and late Camellia Rahman managed to escape the atrocities.

Saidur Rahman later went on to become founder president of Projonmo'71 (Children of the Martyrs of Liberation War) and is a Senior News Presenter of Channel I.

On that very same day, the Pakistan army went on an indiscriminate offensive and killed many innocent Bangladeshis in Sayedpur, before and after the fatal incident involving the family.

Their task was to unload vegetables from trucks that arrived in droves at the market.

The two teenage friends -- Md Sohel and Md Titu -- were of the same age, worked together, stayed at the market together and also planned together how to make more money.

The plans, which soon turned into action, involved petty thefts such as hiding a basket full of vegetables, fish or chicken while unloading and later selling those to make a quick buck.

It worked out for a while, but they eventually got caught. Sohel and Titu were sent to a correctional facility, from where they got out and once again got involved in theft, thus unleashing a chain of events involving robbery, doing time and leading a life of crime.

By the time they became adults, they had been involved in numerous robberies. And by 30, they even formed a gang of robbers with around 15 members who they met at different prisons at different times.

The duo, now 36, used to operate in the capital and its outskirts, and conducted robbery three to four times a week.

But their actions eventually caught up with them when five members of the gang including Sohel got arrested by the Detective Branch of police on Sunday and Titu was killed in a ""gunfight"" with police at Bacchila in Mohammadpur early Tuesday.

In a special drive, officials of Pallabi and Mohammadpur zonal teams arrested the five around 8pm in Mirpur on Sunday, Golam Mostofa Rashel, deputy commissioner of DB (west), told The Daily Star. The other four arrestees are Sohrab (30), Newaz (22), Shaheen (25) and Raju, (25), he added.

Masudur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said interrogating the arrestees, the DB team went on a drive at Bachhila around 12:15am on Tuesday.

Sensing police presence, criminals opened fire, forcing law enforcers to retaliate. At one point, police found one injured person at the spot and took him to Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared him dead, said DC Masud.

Police later came to know that the deceased is Titu. DC Masud said law enforcers also recovered a revolver and knife from the spot.

PHARMACY HEIST

The deputy commissioner of DB (west) said wearing masks, the gang had robbed Billal Pharma in Mohammadpur on April 1 and Lazz Pharma in Khilgaon on April 5.

DB officials said the group mainly conducted robberies in the bordering areas of the capital like Badda, Rampura, Beribadh, Adabar, Mirpur, Jatrabari, Turag and Kanchpur Bridge so that they can flee easily.

Sahadat Hossain, additional deputy commissioner of DB police, said robbing pharmacies was a first for them and they did so as the city roads were empty due to the shutdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

During interrogation, the group members said on April 1 they robbed a pharmacy and intercepted an SUV in Mohammadpur.

""From Lazz Pharma in Khilgaon they took Tk 5,000 and a laptop. Then on April 10, they stopped a truck and looted 15 to 20 cartons of shrimp. They sold those for Tk 25,000 although the actual price should have been Tk 2 lakh,"" said the DB official.

He said the gang never tried to score big to avoid attention and chose soft targets intentionally. ""We will interrogate them further after placing them on remand,"" he added. ""Sohel, who hailed from Noakhali, used to plan the robberies while his friend Titu [from Sylhet] drove the pick-up.""

Being leaders, Titu and Sohel took 80 percent cut of the looted goods, said ADC Sahadat, who led the drive to arrest the five. They had two pick-ups, which they also stole -- one from Mirpur and another from Ashulia -- a few years back, said the DB official.

""We got names of around 14 persons from Sohel. He said they never used all members while conducting a robbery. They used to alternate among them as well as the pick-ups,"" said ADC Sahadat. ""We are now carrying out drives to arrest others,"" he added.

The DB official said both Sohel and Titu had been involved in crimes since childhood and were wanted in multiple cases.

""We would be able to inform clearly about the number of cases against them after analysing documents. Sohel was last arrested in a car robbery case by DB police four years back,"" he added."

The deceased was identified as Zafor Alam, 30, of Nayapara village under Sabrang union, our Cox's Bazar correspondent reports, quoting a BGB official.



BGB members challenged a boat that came from Myanmar by crossing the Naf river and tried to get ashore at Gholarchar ghat, said Lt Colonel Mohammad Faysal Hasan Khan, commanding officer (CO) of BGB Battalion-2 in Teknaf.



However, the people on board fired shots at the border guards, forcing the BGB members to retaliate, triggering a gunfight at the river bank at Shahparirdwip area at around 2:00am, said the CO.



They found an injured person on the spot while the rest managed to flee the scene at one stage of the gunfight, he added.



He was rushed to Teknaf Upazila Health Complex, where doctors declared him dead, the BGB official said.



BGB recovered two lakh yaba pills worth around Tk six crore and a locally made gun from the boat after the incident, said Faysal.



The body was later sent to Cox's Bazar General Hospital for autopsy while BGB filed a case in this regard, he added.

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/the-watermelon-divers-kirtankhola-1894345,2020-04-19 00:00:00+06:00,The watermelon divers of Kirtankhola,"Like the kingfisher dive-bombs into rivers to prey on small fish, these boys plunge into the Kirtankhola to collect stray watermelons every day of the season.

Flowing from the west bank of Barishal city, Kirtankhola plays host to watermelon traders from all around the region. Every day, hundreds of trawlers from Bhola, Patuakhali, and Barguna anchor at Port Road's watermelon trade hub.

The trawlers are filled to the brim before they set sail, and it's almost expected that a few of the green-goodness will be lost to the river. This is where our boys come in.

Jasim (12) and Ibrahim (10) are siblings from nearby Rasulpur slum area. They go to a local primary school, to fifth and fourth grades respectively. Their father is a daywage worker and mother works as a house help.

During watermelon season, the boys get to work at noon. Like other children of the Rasulpur slum, the brothers know how to swim, and they're not afraid to take on the waves. They get on their styrofoam rafts and pick-up stray watermelons, even if they are floating in the middle of the river. They have done this for so long that they might have really developed kingfisher like scoping abilities -- they say nothing escapes their eyes!

Although the coronavirus shutdown is negatively affecting almost everyone else's lives, for the boys, the leisure is but an opportunity to grab even more.

Watermelon is a big fruit, so any number they get is a good number. Once they feel like they have enough, they bring it home and share with the family. For a cash-strapped family like theirs, delicacies are hard to come by, and so these melons bring a lot of extra happiness.

In fact, it's not just watermelons. When the melons are out of stock, the boys collect everything from coconuts, lime, betel gourd, pumpkin, guava, lemon. Basically any and everything that plies the river and drops into it.

The river is like a companion to the children who grow up in Rasulpur, the Barishal City Corporation councillor of the area said. So much so, that some of them harbour dreams to spend the rest of their lives with it. Like Jasim, who said he wants to grow up to be a ""pilot"" of a passenger launch.

""I like the river. If I get to become a pilot, my family can live in more comfort, and we won't have to pick-up watermelons from the river.""

But wait, does this mean he doesn't like doing this? Turns out, that's not the case at all.

""No, no, that's not to say I don't like this. It is my pleasure to dive for watermelons and all the other fruits and vegetables. It has become something of a hobby and it brings me a lot of joy,"" Jasim corrected himself with a smile."

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/rhino-1894036,2020-04-18 00:00:00+06:00,Rhino,"Last week I wrote about the book African Silences by Peter Matthiessen recounting a series of trips he made in Africa in search of birds and wildlife. Along with other animals, the book taught me about the White Rhino.

Among all land mammals in the world, the rhino is second only to the elephant in size. There are five species of rhinos in the world. They are White Rhino, Black Rhino, One-horned Rhino, Javan Rhino and Sumatran Rhino. The White Rhino is the largest, weighing in at around 6000 pounds. (In comparison, the African Elephant weighs up to 15000 pounds.) Rhinos are herbivores, living on grass and leaves. Although large, they are fast and can exceed 30 miles/hour during a charge. They are clad in a thick, protective skin up to 2 inches thick. Man is their only predator; they are killed for their horns used for medicinal purpose. Their name comes from their unique appearance: ""Rhinoceros"" is derived from a Greek word meaning ""nose-horned.""

Matthiessen observes that the White Rhino had two subspecies: Northern White Rhino and Southern White Rhino. The Northern subspecies has become extinct, largely due to wholesale slaughter by humans. For example, in the years following the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Simba rebels slaughtered 90% of the White Rhinos there for the purpose of selling their horns. The proceeds were used to buy more weapons. Subsequent efforts to save the subspecies came to naught.

The Southern White Rhino can be easily seen in South Africa.

The moniker ""White"" is a misnomer – the animals are not really white. It apparently comes from the word ""weit"", an Afrikaner word meaning ""wide"", called so because of their wide mouths. English settlers misheard the name.

The Black Rhino (not really black, but named as a counterpoint to the White Rhino!) is found in Kenya, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. I saw it in Kenya's Lake Nakuru National park which has the world's largest concentration of them: one hundred and fifty. In the early morning light two rhinos were grazing in a meadow. At one point they faced each other and nuzzled their large horns. It was touching to see the show of affection among these two giants.

The Javan Rhino is the rarest rhino, critically endangered, with around seventy-two left in the wild. They are the smallest of the rhinos but still formidable at 3000-5000 pounds. All surviving members live in Ujong Kulon National Park in Java.

The Sumatran Rhino is also critically endangered. It is estimated that less than a hundred live in the wild.

One rhino differs in appearance than all the others. While the rest have two horns, the Greater One Horned Rhino, living in India and Nepal, sports just one. Its story is in stark contrast to the Northern White Rhino. Once close to extinction, efforts to save it succeeded and today it numbers over three thousand, the majority in Kaziranga and Chitwan parks in India and Nepal respectively.

In Bangladesh, there are records of rhinos from the late 1880s and early 1900s. For example, Sundarban was home to a subspecies of the Javan Rhino. However, this subspecies, Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis, has become extinct. At other times Bangladesh also had the Greater One-horned Rhino and the Sumatran Rhino.

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/help-us-get-home-1893628,2020-04-17 00:00:00+06:00,‘Help us get home’: Over 150 Bangladeshis stranded in Australia appeal for repatriation,"Sweety Dhar, in her mid-30s, is a cancer patient and has been in Australia for treatment since September last year.

""I finished my chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery recently. It's been a long and tough journey. My flight was booked on April 3 but it was cancelled, and the airline has not refunded me yet,"" Sweety said.

""My little girl cries for me everyday. I am desperately waiting to go back home"" she told this correspondent helplessly.

She is one of the 150-plus Bangladeshis -- including tourists, students and temporary residents -- who have been stranded in Australia, made an appeal to the government to come back home.

The Australian government has already advised all temporary visa holders -- like students unable to support themselves and those on visitor visas lasting three months or less, to return to their home country as quickly as possible.

In such a situation, many students and temporary residents fell into financial hardships after losing jobs, while tourists are already in cash crunch.

The Bangladesh High Commission in Australia said they uploaded a needs assessment template on its website where persons of Bangladeshi origin in need in Australia are requested to register.

""As of now, 213 people have registered among which 159 would like to travel back to Bangladesh,"" Mohammad Sufiur Rahman, high commissioner for Bangladesh to Australia, told The Daily Star on Tuesday.

The applicants include government employees, bankers, doctors and teachers, and those who came for cancer treatment or to attend conference.

Syeeda Nafisa, a physician by profession, came to Australia as a visitor and has been stuck for the last one month. ""I need to go back to my country to serve at this time of national crisis, since my hospital is already running short of doctors,"" she said.

Masrur Mahmood Shuvo, an employee of a private bank in Bangladesh, has been stuck in Australia after going on a trip with his spouse and daughter. Talking to this correspondent, he said if they fail to find an arrangement, they will have to be stranded there for next six months without income and limited access to funds. Many will have expired passports and visas, he said.

""Under these circumstances, we would request to the authorities to arrange a return flight for us. In case we can arrange a flight, we would need all cooperation from the high commission, the foreign ministry and the aviation ministry to accept our landing proposals and formalities,"" Masrur said.

Meanwhile, most Bangladeshi students there have their job hours slashed, while some even lost their jobs. Nearly half of them are from Victoria, while some are in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.

Mohammad Taukir Muzib, a law student at Swinburne University in Melbourne, said he lost his job and his funds are depleting. ""With this fund, I might be able survive for a month,"" said Taukir. ""Our families in Bangladesh are also worried.""

There are about six thousand Bangladeshi students in Australia, who have to pay USD 16,000 to 20,000 per semester. With the coronavirus forcing a situation of urgency in Bangladesh, many of them are not getting financial help from their families.

In a reply to an email, the Bangladesh high commissioner said they are fully aware of the difficulties Bangladeshis in Australia are facing due to the Covid-19 situation and their officials are in touch with members of the community

""We have made our recommendations to Dhaka. Those include connectivity via Hong Kong or Guangzhou and arrangement of special flights for return. As of now, Bangladesh has not decided to open such flights. We are awaiting a decision,"" he said.

He said they are also working with social, cultural and professional bodies to support Bangladeshis in distress. ""A pool of Bangladeshi doctors [for informal consultation] have been set up for supporting members of our diaspora in Australia.""

""Additionally, the high commission has formally engaged Australian authorities to reduce tuition and ancillary fees for our students. Many universities are responding positively and have written back to us,"" he added."

Investigation officer of the case in December last year submitted charge sheet to a Dhaka Court ""secretly"" under section 304 (B) of Bangladesh Penal Code, which grants imprisonment for three years if proven guilty, although a probe report earlier found that unholy competition between the buses led to his death.

The family filed a no-confidence petition against the charge sheet as they believe the drivers of the two buses -- BRTC and Sajan Paribahan -- should get life sentences.

While they are waiting for hearing of the petition, the drivers -- who were arrested -- recently came out on bail.

Besides, the family is yet to get Tk 50 lakh as compensation, as per a High Court verdict. The matter was stalled as bus authorities filed two separate leave-to-appeal petitions with the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court verdict. The SC is yet to set any date for hearing the appeals.

""It was a murder. Rajib was killed due to the competition of the two buses… But we are in doubt of getting justice as the investigation officer did not submit charge sheet properly,"" Jahanara Begum, aunt of Rajib, told The Daily Star yesterday.

Sub-inspector Idris Ali of Shahbagh Police Station submitted the charge sheet to a Dhaka Court on December 22 last year where he mentioned that he shared his findings with victim's family.

But Jahanara said they came to know about the charge sheet submission in February this year.

Jahanara said their no-confidence petition was scheduled for hearing on April 1 but did not due to the closure of courts following the coronavirus outbreak.

The right hand of Rajib, a third-year student at Titumir Government College in the capital, got stuck between two speeding buses in Karwan Bazar. After being in coma for two weeks, Rajib died on April 17, 2018.

Family members said Rajib and his two brothers were orphaned at an early age. He used to support his brothers with earnings form a part-time job and private tuition. Rajib's brothers Mehedi Hasan Bappi -- a ninth grader -- and Abdulla Hridoy -- an eighth grader -- stay at a hostel of a madrasa in Mir Hazirbagh of Jatrabari.

The family is concerned about their future and believe they would get a little relief if they get the compensation.

Following a writ petition, the High Court on May 8, 2018, ordered the bus companies to pay Tk 1 crore to Rajib's family. BRTC and Sajan Paribahan challenged the HC order and the Supreme Court on May 22 last year stayed the order and asked the HC to form an independent committee to assess the liabilities.

The committee, led by Prof Mizanur Rahman, director of Accident Research Institute at Buet, in its report submitted to the court said reckless driving was the ""primary cause of the accident"".

The report pointed out that the heavy vehicles were being illegally driven by drivers with licences to drive light vehicles.

On October 25 last year, The HC in its full verdict asked BRTC and Sajan Paribahan owners to pay in two months Tk 25 lakh each to Rajib's brothers.

Both BRTC and Sajan authorities later filed leave-to-appeals with the SC. The SC is yet to set any date for hearing on the appeals, BRTC lawyer Barrister Moniruzzaman told The Daily Star.

In the verdict, the HC directed authorities concerned to bring bus services in all metropolitan cities under the franchising system, and said trip-based or daily payment based appointment of public bus drivers should be banned; a company should recruit them with monthly salaries. The court also ordered authorities concerned to run vision and drug tests at the time of granting and renewing licences for drivers of all vehicles.

However, the scenario on the roads -- at least up till the countrywide closure of public transportation late last month -- has not shown any considerable change."

Acting on a tip-off, the coast guard patrol launched a three-day search for the boat, locating it at night off the country's southeastern coast, spokesman Lieutenant Shah Zia Rahman said.

""We have rescued at least 382 Rohingya from a big overcrowded fishing trawler and brought them to a beach near [the coastal town of] Teknaf. They were starving,"" Rahman told AFP, adding that more than 30 had died on board.

""They were floating for 58 days. And over the last seven days it was moving in our territorial waters,"" he said.

The Rohingya, who were thought to be from refugee camps on Bangladesh's southeast coast, were headed to Malaysia, but turned back at sea when that country implemented a strict coastal patrol due to the coronavirus pandemic, a local newspaper said.

Rahman said authorities would investigate the possibility that the refugees could also have come from the Rohingya homeland in Myanmar's restive Rakhine state, where they are a persecuted Muslim minority.

Those rescued reported that ""32 Rohingya died aboard the overcrowded trawler and their bodies were thrown in the sea,"" the official said, adding that an investigation into the matter was under way.

""We have cordoned off the place where they have landed. We could not question them because of the fear they could be infected with the coronavirus,"" he said.

Footage posted on Facebook by a local journalist showed mostly women and children, emaciated and standing on the beach.

A local government administrator told AFP that officials were still counting the rescued but that he feared the number could exceed 400.

Nearly one million Rohingya live in squalid camps near Bangladesh's border with Myanmar, many fleeing the neighboring country after a brutal military crackdown began in 2017.

With few opportunities for jobs and education in the camps, thousands have attempted to reach other countries like Malaysia and Thailand.

Since late last year, Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies have picked up some 1,000 Rohingya from coastal villages and boats as they waited to board vessels bound for Malaysia."

On this day in 1971, Fazlur Rahman, his wife Hosne Akhter, and three sons Mostafizur Rahman Moznu, a college student, Hasinur Rahman Hiron, a school student, and Azizur Rahman Babu, also a school student, were killed at their railway government residence in Sayedpur under Nilphamari by the Pakistani occupation forces and their collaborators for their involvement in the Liberation War.

The extent of the brutality was such that Hosne Akhter, an NGO trainer, was buried alive after being killed by bayonet charging. Only her son Saidur Rahman and two daughters Dilruba Khatun and late Camellia Rahman managed to escape the atrocities.

Saidur Rahman later went on to become founder president of Projonmo'71 (Children of the Martyrs of Liberation War) and is a Senior News Presenter of Channel I.

On that very same day, the Pakistan army went on an indiscriminate offensive and killed many innocent Bangladeshis in Sayedpur, before and after the fatal incident involving the family.

To mark the day, a Qurankhwani and feeding of destitutes was arranged by members of the family, while prayers were offered seeking salvation of the departed souls."

Their task was to unload vegetables from trucks that arrived in droves at the market.

The two teenage friends -- Md Sohel and Md Titu -- were of the same age, worked together, stayed at the market together and also planned together how to make more money.

The plans, which soon turned into action, involved petty thefts such as hiding a basket full of vegetables, fish or chicken while unloading and later selling those to make a quick buck.

It worked out for a while, but they eventually got caught. Sohel and Titu were sent to a correctional facility, from where they got out and once again got involved in theft, thus unleashing a chain of events involving robbery, doing time and leading a life of crime.

By the time they became adults, they had been involved in numerous robberies. And by 30, they even formed a gang of robbers with around 15 members who they met at different prisons at different times.

The duo, now 36, used to operate in the capital and its outskirts, and conducted robbery three to four times a week.

But their actions eventually caught up with them when five members of the gang including Sohel got arrested by the Detective Branch of police on Sunday and Titu was killed in a ""gunfight"" with police at Bacchila in Mohammadpur early Tuesday.

In a special drive, officials of Pallabi and Mohammadpur zonal teams arrested the five around 8pm in Mirpur on Sunday, Golam Mostofa Rashel, deputy commissioner of DB (west), told The Daily Star. The other four arrestees are Sohrab (30), Newaz (22), Shaheen (25) and Raju, (25), he added.

He said the DB teams also seized a pick-up van, Tk 5,000, a machete, iron rod and kitchen knives from them.

Masudur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said interrogating the arrestees, the DB team went on a drive at Bachhila around 12:15am on Tuesday.

Sensing police presence, criminals opened fire, forcing law enforcers to retaliate. At one point, police found one injured person at the spot and took him to Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared him dead, said DC Masud.

Police later came to know that the deceased is Titu. DC Masud said law enforcers also recovered a revolver and knife from the spot.

PHARMACY HEIST

The deputy commissioner of DB (west) said wearing masks, the gang had robbed Billal Pharma in Mohammadpur on April 1 and Lazz Pharma in Khilgaon on April 5.

DB officials said the group mainly conducted robberies in the bordering areas of the capital like Badda, Rampura, Beribadh, Adabar, Mirpur, Jatrabari, Turag and Kanchpur Bridge so that they can flee easily.

Sahadat Hossain, additional deputy commissioner of DB police, said robbing pharmacies was a first for them and they did so as the city roads were empty due to the shutdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

During interrogation, the group members said on April 1 they robbed a pharmacy and intercepted an SUV in Mohammadpur.

""From Lazz Pharma in Khilgaon they took Tk 5,000 and a laptop. Then on April 10, they stopped a truck and looted 15 to 20 cartons of shrimp. They sold those for Tk 25,000 although the actual price should have been Tk 2 lakh,"" said the DB official.

He said the gang never tried to score big to avoid attention and chose soft targets intentionally. ""We will interrogate them further after placing them on remand,"" he added. ""Sohel, who hailed from Noakhali, used to plan the robberies while his friend Titu [from Sylhet] drove the pick-up.""

Being leaders, Titu and Sohel took 80 percent cut of the looted goods, said ADC Sahadat, who led the drive to arrest the five. They had two pick-ups, which they also stole -- one from Mirpur and another from Ashulia -- a few years back, said the DB official.

""We got names of around 14 persons from Sohel. He said they never used all members while conducting a robbery. They used to alternate among them as well as the pick-ups,"" said ADC Sahadat. ""We are now carrying out drives to arrest others,"" he added.

The DB official said both Sohel and Titu had been involved in crimes since childhood and were wanted in multiple cases.

""We would be able to inform clearly about the number of cases against them after analysing documents. Sohel was last arrested in a car robbery case by DB police four years back,"" he added."

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/testing-machine-lying-idle-rmch-4yrs-1893319,2020-04-16 00:00:00+06:00,Testing machine lying idle at RMCH for 4yrs,"While the lone laboratory in Rajshahi division is struggling to cope with the increasing number of samples, a real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine for detecting Covid-19 has been gathering dust at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) for around four years.

The hospital authorities argued that they could not operate the machine due to a lack of skilled manpower, space shortage and required infrastructure.

Yet they allegedly refused several requests of Rajshahi Medical College (RMC), which has the expertise and a coronavirus laboratory to test samples, to let them use the PCR machine during this crisis period, according to sources.

In the last week of March when coronavirus broke out in the country, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) installed a new PCR machine at the medical college as part of the government's programme to assure testing facilities at the grassroots.

The virology department of RMC began using the machine and testing samples from Covid-19 suspects from across eight districts of the division on April 1.

However, DGHS gave the Rajshahi hospital a PCR machine in 2017 for detecting diseases related to bacteria, virus and fungus, said a hospital official.

In May 2018, the RMCH authorities handed over the machine to its outdoor pathology department and set up a room for its installation.

Since then, the PCR machine has been lying unpacked at the department.

Asked, RMCH Deputy Director Saiful Ferdous said the hospital could not use the machine as they lacked expertise. The outdoor [pathology] also has space constraints, he said.

""Working with the machine is risky and requires special training,"" he said, adding that they thought it would have been unwise to use the machine at RMCH's pathology as the department deals with around 500 patients daily.

Talking to The Daily Star, Prof Dr Nasima Sultana, additional director general of DGHS, expressed astonishment as to how a hospital without virology or microbiology departments can have such a machine.

""Only trained virologists or microbiologists can handle it due to critical procedures and bio-hazard,"" she said, adding that she did not even know RMCH had one of such machine.

""I will have to check official documents,"" she said.

According to microbiologists at Rajshahi Medical College, at least 2,500 square feet of space, divided into four specially-designed rooms, is required for installing a PCR machine.

They said they exchanged several letters with the RMCH authorities in 2018 as they wanted to use the machine for students' research activities and testing diseases.

""They [hospital authorities] were totally apathetic [about letting us use the machine] and replied to all our letters in the negative,"" said a microbiologist at RMC.

Prof Sabera Gulnahar, head of the virology department at RMC, acknowledged the information.

""The hospital authorities last week sent a letter, asking us to use their machine when we have engaged all our manpower in using the new one,"" she said.

RMCH Deputy Director Saiful Ferdous said he was unaware why RMC's request to use the machine was denied for such a long time.

Despite repeated attempts, the RMCH director did not answer this correspondent's phone calls and text messages.

Meanwhile, the medical college installed the PCR machine at its coronavirus laboratory. Prof Gulnahar, in-charge of the laboratory, said the number of samples was low initially, which started to increase recently.

They ran at least 481 tests till April 12 with more than 150 samples pending. The laboratory has 40 staff members including 18 microbiologists and biochemists and 12 technicians.

Although the PCR machine is capable of doing 96 tests in every six hours, they are unable to run it more than once a day for lack of manpower, she said.

""Those who perform the tests, wearing personal protective equipment for six hours at a stretch, become exhausted from working extra hours. Working here requires specific attention to details all the time,"" said the professor.

""There is a chance that the pressure may increase in the coming days,"" she said, adding that the machine at RMCH would have helped a lot had it been set up beforehand.

Asked, the RMCH deputy director said they are trying to run the machine with the help of experts from DGHS soon. ""We've identified a spot for installing the machine at the hospital's high dependency unit,"" he said.

There are around 28 PCR machines (18 in Dhaka and 10 in different parts of the country) dedicated for testing Covid-19, according to DGHS.

In addition to that, the government will set up a coronavirus testing laboratory at Bogura in Rajshahi division soon, which will help ease the pressure on the lab at RMC.

Mentionable, rights activists have been requesting the authorities concerned to set up coronavirus testing laboratories at each district."

Ali Hossain Titu (25), a ring leader of a robbery gang, led many robberies and muggings in the city and outskirts amid the shutdown enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus, according to law enforcers.

Golam Mostafa Rasel, deputy commissioner of detective branch (West Division) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, said they arrested five members of the gang on Sunday following robberies at two pharmacies in Mohammadpur on April 1 and Khilgaon on April 5.

The arrestees told detectives about their gang leader Titu who was preparing for another robbery in Mohammadpur's Bosila area around 12:30am today. The gunfight took place when a DB team conducted a drive there, the official said.

Sensing presence of detectives, the robbers opened fire at the law enforcers who retaliated, resulting in the gunfight, he claimed.

As criminals fled away minutes later, detectives found a bullet hit body on the spot and rushed him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

Apart from the robbery at pharmacies, this gang robbed vegetable and poultry laden trucks and mugged people on the empty roads from April 1, the DB official said."

Advocate Md Moniruzzaman Lincoln sent the legal notice to the law and home secretaries through emails, asking them to take necessary steps to this effect in seven days.

He said in the legal notice that some dishonest people including local public representatives are reportedly misappropriating relief materials allocated by the government for the poor and destitute people.

Such irregularities and misappropriation are punishable offence under the law and the offenders can be punished through the mobile court as per the relevant rules of the Mobile Court Act, 2009, the lawyer said.

Besides, the attorney general's office has not extensively taken any move for expeditious hearing of the case's death reference and appeals, considering that an expected judgement may not come from the HC as there are serious weaknesses in the investigation and lack of evidence and documents.

Attorney General Mahbubey Alam, however, told The Daily Star on Sunday that his office will take a step for hearing and disposing of the death reference and appeals of the case after the court reopens.

All the courts across the country including the Appellate and HC divisions of the Supreme Court are now on holidays due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

The courts are scheduled to reopen on April 26.The attorney general said the hearing of the Ramna Batamul killing case might have been finished recently had the courts not gone into holidays.

He, however, refused to comment about the case's merit and possible result.

Contacted, Deputy Attorney General Dr Md Bashir Ahmed said an HC bench led by Justice Krishna Debnath is scheduled to ghold hearings on the death reference and appeals of the case.

Earlier, two separate HC benches had refused to hear the same matters for different reasons.

Attorney general's office sources said the investigation of the case was conducted carelessly during the regime of the then BNP-Jamat led alliance government. Also, the main accused Mufti Abdul Hannan has already been executed in connection with another criminal case.

There is no proper documents and evidence to prove the charges brought against the accused and therefore the state counsels are not all too serious about this case, said sources.

Contacted, Advocate SM Shahjahan, a defense lawyer of the case, could not say anything about the case proceedings.

If a lower court sentences any person to death, its judgement is examined by the HC through hearing arguments for confirmation of the death sentence. The case documents and judgement reaches as death references to the HC from the lower court within seven days after the latter delivers the verdict as per the relevant rules of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Former DAG Moniruzzaman Rubel said another case filed under the explosive substances act in connection with the 2001 Ramna Batamul bomb blast is still pending with a Dhaka court.

The HC bench led by Justice M Enayetur Rahim had started hearing the death references and appeals of the Ramna case on January 8, 2017, and after hearing for several days it adjourned the hearing on February 22 the same year.

This bench dropped the matters from its cause-list on August 8, 2017, as the state side did not officially inform it about the execution of Mufti Hannan.

Later, the CJ assigned the HC bench led by Justice Md Ruhul Quddus to finish the hearing of the death references and appeals. But, this bench could not hear the case as it's hearing jurisdiction was reconstituted.

A Dhaka court on June 23, 2014 handed down death penalty to eight militants of Harkat-ul-Jihad (Huji), including its chief Mufti Abdul Hannan, for killing 10 people in the attack on a Chhayanaut event during the Pahela Baishakh celebrations at Ramna Batamul on April 14 in 2001.

Six other militants of the banned Islamist outfit were sentenced to life in prison for involvement in the blasts."

But none of them could have imagined what would happen in the coming days.

Covid-19 has brought the whole country to a standstill, no celebrations, no hang outs, no nothing.

Like any other holiday, Pahela Baishakh normally sees people thronging restaurants and juice bars with their near and dear ones to celebrate.

But against the backdrop of rising infections and death toll, the government has prohibited all sorts of outdoor gatherings.

Restaurant owners and staffers are struggling to stay afloat in these trying times. The miseries that come when one's short of money to feed their family is often too much to bear.

""Staffers have gone to their homes after the shutdown, but recently they started reaching out to us, as they need money to survive,"" said Khandaker Ruhul Amin, president of Bangladesh Restaurant Owners Association.

""We are discouraging staffers to return to the capital,"" said Ruhul, also a director of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries. ""We're now making a list of staffers to extend some support.""

Faisal Ahmed, owner of Faisal Juice Bar and Indian Food at the capital's Wari, has been operating the business for the last seven years.

Although Bangla New Year is only celebrated for one day, a huge number of customers visit restaurants for three to four days, he said.

""We always prepare for these special days round the year. This year, we bought Tk 50,000-60,000 worth of fruits, but now, we have no choice but to eat them ourselves. Some fruits were distributed among the staff and the shop has been completely closed for the shutdown,"" he added.

It's not just Faisal who is desperately trying to deal with the crisis. According to the association, some nine lakh people working at 30,000 restaurants, 8,000 of which are in Dhaka city alone, are all suffering.

""On last year's Pahela Baishakh, our sales shot up by nearly three times than the usual,"" said Md Sumonuzzaman, operation manager of Just Juice.

He said they have six outlets in Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara and Uttara, where about 40 staffers work. But since March 20, when the situation gradually began deteriorating, these outlets were shut. They are now struggling to pay their employees' salaries and rent.

On March 31, the prime minister directed all to celebrate this year's Pahela Baishakh digitally, without creating any mass gatherings, in line with the government's ""stay-at-home"" guideline.

To bring back a little bit of Baishakhi celebration, the association is planning to introduce some special food items, but they will only be available for take-away.

""We don't need any donation, but we need low-interest loans. If the government takes steps to provide support and facilitate loans through the association, then we and our staff will be able to get through this crisis,"" he added.

On April 5, the prime minister unveiled a stimulus package of Tk 30,000 crore, which will be provided to affected industries and service sector organisations as working capital through banks as low-interest loans."

The study was part of Brac University's James P Grant School of Public Health's (JPGSPH) series of rapid research assessments including surveys throughout the country in informal settlements to understand the brunt of the pandemic on the lives of diverse communities.

In Dhaka city, about 80 case studies were conducted to explore daily experiences as well as emotional and mental well-being of inhabitants of six slums located in both city corporations.

Residents who participated in the interviews were mostly informal sector workers who once relied on daily incomes. They were generally the most vulnerable to the impending pandemic.

The respondents shared they were grappling with daily emotions of ""panic, restlessness, hopelessness, fear, and were occasionally breaking down"", as uncertainly over the current situation increases.

Living in congested spaces with inadequate access to clean water and improved sanitation creates another level of anxiety, as several respondents shared they were unable to maintain the recommended precautions.

Some respondents reported physical manifestation of continued stress, saying they feel aches and pains.

Some women inhabitants said the financial instability is negatively affecting family relationships.

Many residents of slums said crime has gone up as well, due to increasing financial hardship and social insecurity.

Most of the inhabitants shared that their lives were now caught up in a cycle of uncertainty.

In the press release, the organisation said the impact of this outbreak goes beyond health and economic aspects, and it's likely to leave a longer-term toll particularly on the poor households living in these settlements."

Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain took the decision at a meeting with the judges of the Appellate Division at his official residence in the capital's Kakrail yesterday.

The Supreme Court has so far extended the court holiday for three times beginning on March 25.

Supreme Court's Registrar General Md Ali Akbar issued two separate circulars in this regard.

In a circular it has been stated the apex court judges decided that the court functions should not be kept open on a short scale amid the ongoing coronavirus spread as judges, lawyers, officials and staff members need to gather for running the court activities, which may cause harm to their health.

Another circular said the ad-interim orders passed by the courts earlier -- giving bails to the accused, stay of trial proceedings of cases and directives for surrender of the accused to lower courts -- will be extended for two weeks after reopening of the courts.

Besides, one or multiple magistrates will remain standby at all the metropolitan and district areas as usual in order to deal with urgent cases like remand prayers, according to the circular."

http://www.thedailystar.net/city/news/lack-icu-beds-remains-worry-sylhet-division-1894690,2020-04-20 00:00:00+06:00,Lack of ICU beds remains a worry in Sylhet division,"While it may sound reassuring to hear that Sylhet division has 589 beds dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients in isolation centres. However, that enthusiasm might start to fade in the face of some details -- out of these 589, only two are ICU beds.

Both of these are located at the ""Corona Isolation Centre"" in Sylhet city's Saheed Shamsuddin Ahmed Hospital.

Though nine more ICU beds and four ventilators are being installed at this dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility, medical experts say this will not be enough if the contagion continues to spread.

According to the divisional health office in Sylhet, there are a total of 103 ICU facilities in Sylhet, which includes 15 functional beds at Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, while the rest are at private medical colleges and hospitals in the district.

However, there is no ICU facility available across Sunamganj, Moulvibazar and Habiganj districts; not even at the Sheikh Hasina Medical College Hospital in Habiganj.

According to the fourth version of 'National Guidelines on Clinical Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)', critically ill patients should be treated in intensive care units (ICU).

Professor AFM Nazmul Islam, former head of the department of medicine at Osmani Medical College, said, ""A patient's vital functions are respiration, circulation, blood pressure and oxygenation, all of which are functions of the lungs and heart. Those who cannot maintain vital functions need to be taken to intensive care. Around five percent of the total Covid-19 infected get to a critical stage where this care is required.""

""Considering the population density of the country, if we estimate one lakh infected cases, at least five thousand of them will be critical, and at least one to two thousand of them will need ICU facility. It's time to plan beforehand as cases keep rising every day,"" he said.

So far, only seven people have tested Covid-19 positive in the division, including a deceased doctor and an elderly. Moreover, one was detained in Sunamganj after fleeing from Dhaka after testing positive.

Among them, three are being treated at Sylhet Saheed Shamsuddin Ahmed Hospital, two in Sunamganj Sadar Hospital and one in Habiganj Sadar Hospital.

Contacted, Civil Surgeons of Sunamganj, Moulvibazar and Habiganj all said that they have sent requisition for ICU facilities to the Directorate General of Health Services but received no further instruction.

They also said they have no option but to refer positive patients in critical condition to Sylhet or Dhaka.

Dr Anisur Rahman, assistant director (disease control) of Sylhet divisional health office, said, ""We are considering using private hospitals' ICU facility if needed, but this privilege is not available for the other districts where no such facility is available.""

Besides the lack of ICU beds, the region is also suffering from a lack of expertise. ""We are in acute shortage of anesthesiologists in Sylhet. Without trained experts, there will be no meaning of installing ICU,"" he said."

The deceased was identified as Zafor Alam, 30, of Nayapara village under Sabrang union, our Cox's Bazar correspondent reports, quoting a BGB official.



BGB members challenged a boat that came from Myanmar by crossing the Naf river and tried to get ashore at Gholarchar ghat, said Lt Colonel Mohammad Faysal Hasan Khan, commanding officer (CO) of BGB Battalion-2 in Teknaf.



However, the people on board fired shots at the border guards, forcing the BGB members to retaliate, triggering a gunfight at the river bank at Shahparirdwip area at around 2:00am, said the CO.



They found an injured person on the spot while the rest managed to flee the scene at one stage of the gunfight, he added.



He was rushed to Teknaf Upazila Health Complex, where doctors declared him dead, the BGB official said.



BGB recovered two lakh yaba pills worth around Tk six crore and a locally made gun from the boat after the incident, said Faysal.



The body was later sent to Cox's Bazar General Hospital for autopsy while BGB filed a case in this regard, he added.

He said the flights of private airlines will be operated in next seven to ten days and then they will try to operate flights of Biman Bangladesh Airlines and other airlines upon permission from the Indian government.

Shahriar said the government will take initiative to bring back Bangladeshis from other Indian cities including Delhi after bringing back patients who went to India for treatment.

Some 2,500 Bangladeshi nationals, including over 1,000 students, got stuck in different Indian cities due to lockdown, according to the Foreign Ministry.

US-Bangla Airlines will operate special flights to bring back Bangladesh nationals who got stranded in Chennai and Kolkata due to countrywide lockdown in India amid coronavirus outbreak.

Despite testing positive for coronavirus, the four policemen have found ways to keep their spirits high and motivate each other. A video of them exercising has gone viral on social media, providing inspiration to others who might need it.

Around 80 police personnel from Chandni Mahal police station in central Delhi were tested for COVID-19 infection. Among the eight who tested positive were Constable Mukesh, Head Constables Yadram and Ravinder, and Assistant Sub-Inspector Dev Karan. The four policemen were admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on April 20.

None of them knew whether they got infected during patrol or picket duty. Some of them were involved in moving Tablighi Jamaat followers to quarantine centres and suspect they might have contracted the virus during the process.

The four are kept in the same ward of RML Hospital and recuperating in the company of each other.

To motivate themselves and remain positive, they exercise and practice yoga every morning before their breakfast arrives by 10:30 am. Through the day, they solve puzzles, crack jokes (sometimes about themselves) and listen to music and bhajans. In the evening, they walk inside the room for an hour to maintain their fitness.

Since April 3, when he left his home for duty, the 55-year-old Head Constable Yadram hasn't met his family in Bahadurgarh in Haryana.

""I speak to them on video calls. They are obviously tensed about my health and complain I don't speak to them often... I tell my family to stay positive. With positive attitude and God's grace, we will recover soon,"" he said.

Inside the hospital ward, ""We solve puzzles, crack jokes, exercise and practice yoga. It really helps us,"" he added. Mukesh, 31, had light fever when he was tested and felt extremely weak. He said he feels better now, though at times he suffers from throat pain.

He said he has not visited his family for more than a month.

""But I stay positive and we keep telling each other that we are fine. We will recover soon. Only positive thinking can help us fight this battle,"" he said.

Ravinder, 55, had initially dismissed the fever and throat infection as symptoms of flu. His family stays in trans-Yamuna area of Delhi.

""My children have watched the video of me exercising in the hospital ward with my colleagues. They were happy to see me on news channels. Exercise helps us sleep at night, otherwise it would be difficult,"" he said.

The policeman said they are raring to get back to duty.

""Doctors tell us that we are onto recovery and we hope we will be able to resume duty soon,"" he said. Assistant Sub-Inspector Karan said, ""My family is in Alwar and it's been more than a month I saw them. I interact with them over video calls and phone calls.""

Mortal remains of Kamlesh Bhatt, an Indian national, who was working in UAE, was sent back from the Delhi airport, despite the fact that he had died of a heart attack and not due to the novel coronavirus.

His family from Tehri in Uttarakhand had appealed the Indian authorities to facilitate the return of Kamlesh Bhatt's body to India after he died of a heart attack on April 16.

While all the clearances were given and Etihad Airways flew the mortal remains of three Indian nationals to India, including Kamlesh Bhatt's, the bodies were sent back to the UAE.

Sources have told India Today TV that the Indian mission in Abu Dhabi and the consulate in Dubai have been sending the mortal remains of Indians who died of other causes even during the lockdown period.

""This is the first case of bodies being sent back to the UAE during this period,"" said the source.

India Today TV has learned that the Delhi Airport had given clearance for the cargo of the mortal remains to Etihad Airways, but on arrival, the Bureau of Immigration refused permission to offload the bodies at the Delhi airport.

While the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is yet to respond to what happened and if there has been a change in the policy of the government, it is learned that there has been no intimation of a change in government policy on the return of mortal remains of non-Covid patients.

The Narendra Modi administration's policy on Indian nationals is clear. Nobody will be allowed entry into India until further notice. The Indian missions have not been sending mortal remains of Covid-19 patients either.

""But, bodies of non-Covid patients have regularly been flown home. Embassies and MEA have not been intimated of any change in policy,"" a source said.

Owing to the confusion, mortal remains that were separately sent to Chennai have been held at the airport and not released to the respective families.

While a devastated families wait for clarity on whether they will get to perform the final rites of their loved ones, who passed away on foreign soil, it is clear that the Embassy of India in UAE gave a NOC (No Objection Certificate) based on the letter given by the family and after checking that all local formalities were complete and clearances from the airport to receive cargo were issued, as per laid down procedures and protocol."

The lockdown was later extended till May 3 in view of the rising cases of Covid-19 that were reported from various parts of India.

It has been a month since the country is in a lockdown, which has halted the economic activity in India and left many jobless, the question which has now been asked is if it has been effective and will India's coronavirus curve will flatten by mid-May.

Analysis to this effect has been done by the health experts, studying the projections of the rising cases of coronavirus before and after the lockdown. The graph shows a new, cumulative, and doubling rate of coronavirus cases till May 16.

'LOCKDOWN DECISION TIMELY, CURVE HAS BEGIN TO FLATTEN'

""Decision of lockdown was timely, the curve has begun to flatten. The nation has shown that lockdown has been effective, saving lives, containing Covid-19 infection and slowing down doubling rate. We need to build on these gains,"" Dr VK Paul, a retired professor at AIIMS, Delhi, and member (Health) at Niti Aayog, said.

Even as the number of new cases touched more than 23,000 on April 24, and the cumulative new cases per day in the country stood at 1,684 per day, the projection shows a trend that moves in the downward curve to zero till May 16.

The government informed that the doubling rate stood at 8.6 as on April 24 and was projected to be at 10 in the next few days. ""We have also seen projections tell us that it may reach 14 days in coming time,"" Dr Paul said.

India's top health policy experts rallied in the favour of the lockdown on Friday citing several analyses.

Without the travel bans, lockdown, and other containment measures, India would have 8,51,505 Covid-19 patients between March 21 and April 23, said the data presented by the Indian government on Friday.

In another graph, Dr Paul showed that India would have 73,400 Covid-19 cases between March 25 and April 23 if the average daily growth of such patients was 16 per cent as seen between March 25 and April 6.

However, a lower number has illustrated the impacts of containment measures India undertook to contain the spread of the virus."

In a late-night order on Friday, the government allowed shops providing non-essential goods and services to the general public to open from Saturday amid the coronavirus lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the infection.

While the opening of the neighbourhood and stand-alone shops have now been permitted to start their services from Saturday, the big question for the people in lockdown is if the liquor shops and bars, too, have been allowed to begin their services.

According to the government order, the bars and liquor shops will not be allowed to sell or serve alcohol.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued the lockdown relaxations for the shops that come under 'Shops and Establishment Act'. The ministry has also clarified that alcohol comes under a separate clause and not under the Shops and Establishment Act.

No bar selling liquor has been allowed to reopen.

Earlier, two states -- Assam and Meghalaya -- allowed the opening of the liquor shops in the first phase of lockdown, which was from March 25 to April 14. However, the liquor shops in the two Northeastern states were ordered to shut down from April 15.

The Central government, in its guidelines for the lockdown issued on April 15, made it clear that there should be a strict ban on the sale of liquor, gutka, tobacco during the lockdown.

The government on Friday night allowed the opening of neighbourhood and standalone shops, including those located in residential complexes within municipal areas, but at a 50 per cent strength and after taking necessary precautions.

However, the shops in market places, multi-brand and single-brand malls located in municipality areas shall continue to remain closed till May 3.

The shops that are being allowed to open from Saturday will mandatorily have 50 per cent strength of workers wearing of masks and following social distancing.

No relaxations have been given to the hotspot and containment areas.

MHA REJECTS PUNJAB GOVT'S REQUEST FOR OPENING OF LIQUOR SHOPS

The Union Home Ministry on Thursday rejected the Punjab government's request for the opening of liquor shops in the state during lockdown.

The request came after the Home Ministry made it clear in its consolidated revised guidelines that no liquor shop will be allowed to open anywhere in the country."

With the latest order from the government, the registered neighbourhood and stand-alone shops have been permitted to open amid the coronavirus lockdown.

The shops that are allowed to open during the coronavirus lockdown from Saturday include those located in residential complexes within and outside the limits of municipalities and municipal areas. However, market complexes within the limits of municipal corporations and municipalities will not open from Saturday.

The concession, however, has not been extended to shops in market places, multi-brand, and single-brand malls located in municipality areas, coronavirus hotspots and containment areas.

The opening of shops selling non-essential goods and services from Saturday, according to the order released by the MHA in a modification of its April 15 order, will be subjected to the conditions that they will run with 50 per cent strength of workers, wearing of masks and following social distancing.

As the government order has now allowed some economic activity, here's a list of what will remain open and what will remain closed from Saturday:

WHAT WILL OPEN FROM SATURDAY

Naveen Patnaik later interacted with the members of the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA).

The religious event has been held uninterrupted since 1736, according to Bhaskar Mishra, a researcher in Jagannath Culture.

Puri Gajapati Dibyasingh Deb, after chairing Srimandir Managing Committee meeting on Friday via video conference, said, ""Since the lockdown restrictions in the battle against Covid-19 are in force till May 3, there can be no public participation in any of rituals conducted outside any temple across the country till that period.""

According to the Government of India's order, all places of worship will remain closed for public till May 3. The order also prohibits religious congregations, without any exception.

Puri Gajapati Dibyasingh Deb said that the temple management committee has to abide by it.

The rituals of Lord Jagannath performed outside Srimandir during Chandan Jatra cannot be conducted during lockdown.

The processing for Rath Yatra that commences from Akshaya Tritiya as per Jagannath culture every year cannot take place till May 3. As the chariots are made outside the temple premises, it is unlikely to start from Akshaya Tritiya (April 26) as per the tradition, he said.

""Since all the managing committee members do not want to break the century-old tradition, we will seek alternative means from the Shankaracharya on how to conduct rituals outside the temple during the lockdown,"" he said.

Dibyasingh Deb, meanwhile, said any decision on the annual festival, scheduled for June 23, will be taken in accordance with the guidelines released after the lockdown is lifted on May 3.

""The committee members unanimously agreed that the 12th-century shrine will abide by the lockdown guidelines implemented both by the central and the state government. Therefore, all activities outside the temple will not be held before May 3,"" the Gajapati Maharaj said in a video message.

Lakhs of devotees from various parts of the world throng in Jaganath Dham, Puri to witness the annual sojourn of the Holy Trinity - Lord Balabhadra, Mahaprabhu Jagannath and Devi Subhadra. Since social distancing is not possible with such a huge crowd, there is uncertainty about the Rath Yatra being held this year."

Alarmed by the rising number of infected patients in Agra, the medical fraternity is finding it difficult to screen all the suspected cases and has urged the local population to do regular self-screening based on a set of symptoms that may serve as a warning of the impending infection.

Senior ENT Surgeon Dr Devashish Bhattacharya claimed that the way the infection has spread from Agra to the rural areas, as well as the nearby districts, is alarming. He said that although the ICMR has officially not declared it as community spread as of yet, the way greengrocers, milk vendors, chemists, and even a thief was found infected in Agra with no contact or travel history, community spread appears to have begun in the district.

Asked if there was any chance that Covid-19 will not have a major effect in India due to the environmental conditions here, Dr Bhattacharya said that at this point of time, it could be assumed that this virus was here to stay, and avoiding the infection was possible only to some extent with social distancing. At some point in time, if a vaccine is not developed, herd immunity will be the only likely scenario for survival.

Citing the high prices of PPE Kits, Dr Bhattacharya said that the kits being made available to private physicians and surgeons were for one-time use only and were quite expensive, making it difficult for private practitioners to afford them for themselves and their staff every day. He said that the PPE kits need to be made affordable as at any private practitioner's clinic, at least 3-4 kits will be required every day and at the current prices, they are not affordable for a lot of doctors.

Senior physician Dr SK Kalra told India Today that after a number of doctors and healthcare workers got infected with the virus, it has become hard for the medical professionals to treat the patients for even the smallest of illnesses, without first ascertaining that they were not infected with the virus. If people could self-screen themselves before coming to the doctor, it could help medical practitioners a great deal."

Centre reopens shops selling non-essential goods, hopes to bend coronavirus curve by May 3","Coronavirus: India registers over 1,700 new cases on eve of Ramzan, Centre hopes to bend the curve by May 3 (PTI photo)

On Day 31 of the nationwide lockdown, India can hope to see light at the end of the tunnel. The Centre has claimed that if the current trend continues India will be able to bend the curve of novel coronavirus before May 3 - the end of Lockdown 2.0. The hope finds further ground as the Ministry of Home Affairs has announced that shops selling non-essential goods in municipal areas can reopen. Click here to know what will open and what will remain closed from Saturday.

This comes, even as the country on Friday recorded 1,752 fresh cases taking the total number of infected people to 23,452 even as doubling rate of the disease improved to 10 days from 7.5 reported earlier this week. The death toll from the infection rose to 723 with 37 fatalities reported since Thursday evening

It is the biggest single-day spike in the number of cases in India and it comes on the eve of the month of Ramzan.

But the good news is that India's recovery rate has reached 20.52 per cent and the mortality rate is limited to 3 per cent, which is less than the global average of around 7 per cent. The Centre, in a presentation issued at the daily presser, claimed that the Covid-19 curve in India will bend by May 3.

Here are the top developments in Covid-19 outbreak, treatment and testing in India:

Non-essential goods shops to reopen

In a late-night order on Friday, the Union Home Ministry said that shops selling non-essential goods can resume operations. However, shopping complexes and malls will continue to remain shut.

The order also means that local shops and small businesses in residential complexes can reopen. However, the shop keepers can only operate with 50 per cent strength while keeping in mind the social distancing norms along with use of masks.

The local salons and parlours will be allowed to operate from Saturday. Big shops/brands/market places will remain shut. As for the liquor shops, the MHA has clarified that alcohol comes under a separate clause and not under the shops and establishment act.

""All registered shops regd under Shops & Establishment Act of respective States/ UTs, including shops in residential complexes, neighborhood & standalone shops exempted from #lockdown restrictions. Prohibited: Shops in single & multi brand malls,"" the MHA Twitter handle said.

""Market complexes, except those within the limits of municipal corporations and municipalities, are allowed to open. Mandatory: 50% strength of workers, wearing of masks & observing #SocialDistancing. Relaxations not applicable in #Hotspots/containment zones,"" it said.

The Centre has been trying to phase out one of the world's strictest lockdowns with regular sectoral relaxations. In its earlier order, Centre had allowed agriculture and its related bodies to operate. A part of industries has also been opened for business. Construction-related to water conservation has also started in the green zones.

All relaxations being announced by the Centre are only applicable to area which have been categories as green zones, which means there are no positive cases of the novel coronavirus.

Highest spike in cases and high recovery rate

India on Friday recorded 1,752 fresh cases taking the total number of infected people to 23,452 even as doubling rate of the disease improved to 10 days from 7.5 reported earlier this week, according to the Health Ministry.

The death toll from the infection rose to 723 with 37 fatalities reported since Thursday evening, said an official, adding about 20.52 per cent of the infected people have recovered so far.

Out of the total 1,752 new cases, Maharashtra reported the highest number of 778 new infections followed by Gujarat with 217 cases and Madhya Pradesh with 157 cases, according to government data.

The previous highest single-day increase of the infection was on April 20 when 1,540 cases were reported. India's first coronavirus case was reported on January 30.

The Centre said the lockdown has been effective in slowing down the rate of spread of the deadly infection and that the doubling rate now stands at 10 days.

On April 20, the Health Ministry said the doubling rate has improved to 7.5 days as against 3.4 days before the nationwide lockdown was imposed.

Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said that 15 districts in the country which earlier reported cases of the infection have not reported any fresh cases in the last 28 days.

Further, a total of 80 districts from 23 states and union territories have not reported any new cases since the last 14 days.

Curve to bend by May 3

As the end of Lockdown 2.0 comes closer, the dim about another possible extension is becoming louder. But, if the government is to be believed, the projections based on current trends say that India will be able to bend the corona curve by May 3.

In a graph shared by Dr VK Paul, Chairman on Coronavirus Empowered Group-1, the data says that the number of coronavirus cases in India is likely to peak on April 29 and by the time lockdown is supposed to end, May 3, the curve would be bent.

The graph showed the projections till May 16, by when the Centre hopes to hit an R0 of 0.904. R0 or R-naught is the number of people a sick person is likely to infect. R0 below 1 is crucial to defeat the pandemic.

Without lockdown, number of cases in India would have been 73,000

Using another graph, Dr Paul said that the decision of imposing the lockdown was timely as without it the number of cases in India could have been more than 73,000, where now the figure stood around 23,000.

Centre rushes IMCTs as situation worsens in Gujarat

The Ministry of Home Affairs on Friday rushed inter-ministerial central teams to Gujarat's cities Ahmedabad and Surat as the situation became grim in the state. On Friday, Gujarat surged passed Delhi to become the state with the second-highest number of cases of the novel coronavirus.

The assessment by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) came on a day when Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra said the number of Covid-19 patients in the Gujarat city may grow to eight lakh by the end of May if the current four-day period of doubling of the cases continues. So far, Ahmedabad city has reported 1,638 cases, the highest in Gujarat which accounted for over 2,800 infections.

In a statement, the MHA said violations of lockdown measures reported in some parts of the country posed a serious health hazard to public and may lead to the spread of Covid-19.

""The situation is especially serious in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat (Gujarat),"" it said. The MHA has also made similar arrangments for Thane (Maharashtra), Hyderabad (Telangana) and Chennai (Tamil Nadu).

Four teams headed by Additional Secretary-level officers will visit Ahmedabad, Surat, Hyderabad and Chennai, MHA Joint Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava told a press conference. These teams will be in addition to the six IMCTs constituted earlier, she said.

The teams have been constituted for a spot assessment of the Covid-19 hotspot districts.

The six teams are in Mumbai, Pune (Maharashtra), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Jaipur (Rajasthan) and West Bengal (one team for Kolkata and adjoining districts and the other for North Bengal). The team in Mumbai will also visit Thane.

The IMCTs would use the expertise of the central government and augment the states' efforts to fight and contain the spread of Covid-19 effectively.

Is Bengal hiding toll?

West Bengal continues to be at loggerheads with the Centre over the Covid-19 pandemic management. The central team visiting Kolkata to assess the Covid-19 situation wrote to the West Bengal government on Friday seeking a detailed report on the functioning of the coronavirus death audit committee and a meeting with its members and expressed displeasure at the arrangements in hospitals and quarantine centres.

In a letter to Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, the inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) led by senior bureaucrat Apurba Chandra, sought to know the system of approving the declaration of the death of Covid-19 patients by the committee of doctors, which was set up by the state government.

There have been allegations from various quarters that the state government is hiding coronavirus cases and deaths.

West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha on Friday released figures stating that 57 patients, who tested positive for Covid-19 in the state, have died. Only 18 of those deaths can be attributed to Covid-19 with the remaining 39 occurring due to pre-existing conditions or co-morbidity, Rajiva Sinha claimed.

The team sought the case records of all the Covid-19 patients, where the cause of death is attributed to some other cause by the committee.

""We would like to know whether such a committee is in line with ICMR guidelines or medical practice,"" Chandra added.

Referring to his visit to hospitals and quarantine centres in Kolkata on Thursday, Chandra said the patient admission process appeared to be chaotic and there was no social distancing at the patient's waiting area. The letter also pointed towards lack of medical preparedness at several hospitals to fight Covid-19 as well as testing labs.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier slammed the Centre for sending the teams to look into the state's preparedness for tackling the Covid-19 outbreak and alleged that faulty testing kits were dispatched to the state.

Rapid antibody test kits fine, the problem is with use: China firms

Two Chinese firms India procured 5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from - Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics- have claimed that kits were fine but the problem was that they were not being used or stored as per proper instructions in the user manuals.

Several Indian states, including West Bengal and Rajasthan, had claimed that the testing kits procured by Centre from China were not effective. However, the ICMR has said that since rapid test kits can only be used for surveillance, the states should focus on RT-PCR testing.

Plasma therapy in India

Meanwhile, there have been encouraging reports about convalescent plasma therapy in India. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that four patients who were administered this therapy have shown good results.

""Ten days ago, we had got permission from the Central government to conduct a clinical trial of plasma therapy only on four serious Covid-19 patients admitted at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. The initial results are very encouraging and good. It gives a ray of hope to save people's lives from coronavirus,"" he said.

The Centre has also given a green signal for use of the plasma therapy in Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka.

In this therapy, antibodies developed in the body of the patients recovered of Covid-19 are used to treat critical patients.

PM Modi hails grit and wisdom of rural India

The coronavirus pandemic has taught the country ""to be self-reliant and self-sufficient"" and not look for solutions abroad, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told grassroots leaders on Friday as he stressed that every village, district and state should be able to provide for its basic needs.

Applauding people for their grit in fighting the Covid-19 outbreak, Modi said “the collective power of the villages is helping the country move forward” and complimented the rural India for its simple and motivating mantra of “Do Gaz Ki Doori” to popularise social distancing.

The prime minister was interacting with gram panchayat heads and members to mark Panchayati Raj Divas on Friday. The programme was scheduled to be held in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh but was held by a video bridge following the coronavirus-induced lockdown.

Ramzan

As India finished one month of the nationwide lockdown, the country's one-fifth population is set to start another crucial month. The holy month of Ramzan begins from Saturday. During this month, Muslims observe fast from sunset to sunrise and break the fast at family gatherings with prayers and feasts.

At the behest of the holy month, several political leaders and celebrities came forward and issued appeals for everyone observing Ramzan to stay indoors and not hold or attend gatherings during iftar.

Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari and Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri mosque Mufti Mukarram Ahmed appealed to Muslims to perform all rituals and prayers at home during Ramzan while adhering to social distancing and lockdown norms.

President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended Ramzan greetings, hoping that the people achieve a decisive victory in the ongoing battle against coronavirus and create a healthier planet. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also wished the people.

With the lockdown in place till May 3, this will be a Ramzan without the usual gatherings at prayer time and during meals.

All imams, Ulema and Muslim organisations in the country have unanimously decided that during Ramzan, Muslims will not congregate in mosques, religious places and perform all rituals like 'Iftaar' (breaking of fast) and 'Taraweeh' (special prayers) at home keeping in mind social distancing norms.

Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said he has spoken to state waqf board officials, social and religious leaders, imams on adherence to the lockdown and social distancing guidelines during Ramzan.

He expressed confidence that Muslims will adhere to the lockdown and social distancing guidelines."

(Photo: PTI)

Eight employees' unions of Air India on Friday requested Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri to ask the airline to roll back its Covid-19 lockdown-triggered decision to cut 10 per cent pay of its employees.

Air India raised the demand, while commending the IndiGo's decision on Thursday to roll back pay cuts, which were announced last month for senior staff members, for the month of April in deference to the government's wishes.

The joint letter by eight AI employees' unions to Puri on Friday stated, ""We request you to countermand Air India committee's decision on Covid-19 pay cut which is against the government's directives and also treat us at par with other PSUs (public sector units) during the lockdown.""

Air India has decided to cut salaries of all employees by 10 per cent for three months.

On March 23, the Modi government had asked public and private sector companies not to cut salaries or lay off employees amid the Covid-19 lockdown.

""This pay cut by Air India is mere optics, unnecessary and will hit the morale of the employees which will have a cascading effect on the Indian economy,"" the unions' letter stated.

""In spite of instructions from the Government of India concerning the welfare of the employees and directions to make payment of wages on due date, the management of Air India defaulted on timely payment of salary which was paid on 18th April, 2020, with a 10 per cent pay cut,"" it stated.

The flying crew are yet to receive 70 per cent of their wages for the work done in the month of February, the letter added.

As India has been under a lockdown since March 25 to curb the coronavirus pandemic spread, all commercial passenger flights have been suspended for this period. Consequently, revenues of aviation sector companies have been hit hard.

""We admire the decision by the top management of a private airline not to implement the previously announced pay cuts in deference to the government's wishes of not reducing pay during the lockdown,"" the letter noted.

While IndiGo had announced on March 19 that it is cutting salaries of senior employees by up to 25 per cent, the budget carrier rolled it back on Thursday for the month of April ""in deference to our government's wishes"".

However, the private airline clarified that few senior employees -- the members of the Executive Committee and senior vice presidents -- have voluntarily taken the pay cut in April.

While a private airline is honouring the directions of the government, it is of ""great consequence for Air India to follow suit and also lead by example"", the letter by Air India unions stated.

Any pay cut with regards to Covid-19 lockdown has to be voluntary in nature as followed by the senior management of the private airline, the letter noted.

The eight unions that wrote to Puri are: Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, Indian Pilots' Guild, Air Corporations Employees' Union, All India Cabin Crew Association, All India Aircraft Engineers' Association, Air India Employees' Union, All India Aircraft Engineers' Association and Indian Aircraft Technicians' Association."

The top four districts in terms of number of Covid-19 cases are: Khurda with 46 cases, Bhadrak - 16, Jajpur - 12 and Balasore - 10, said Surbato Bagchi, Chief Spokesperson of Odisha government for Covid-19 management.

Balasore, Bhadrak and Jajpur are under a 60-hour lockdown since last night.

Meanwhile, Subrato Bagchi appealed to the people of Balasore, Bhadrak and Jajpur districts to set an example and show the way for successful handling of fourth phase of coronavirus in the state when around 5 lakh stranded Odias are expected to return to their homeland after lockdown ends on May 3."

The operation was launched after the police learned of the abduction of an RPF constable later identified as Sartaj from his residence in Shirpora village in Baramulla district.

It was the constable's family that managed to alert authorities. Soon after, security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search and rescue operation. Within minutes, two men in a white-coloured car opened fire at security personnel at a Nakka in Yaripora. They were the same militants who had abducted the constable. This led to an exchange of gunfire that lasted for nearly ten minutes.

The security forces managed to subdue the two men and rescue the constable. One policeman incurred injuries during the exchange of gunfire.

Around 9:30 pm on Friday, the Kashmir Zone Police took to Twitter to declare that two militants had been killed in an exchange of gunfire with security forces and the abducted constable had been rescued.

This is the second abduction of a policeman in Kashmir in two days. On Thursday, a cop was abducted from the Shopian district. The police immediately swung into action and managed to rescue the abducted policeman.

Despite the holy month of Ramadan beginning on Friday, the union territory seems to have no respite from terror-related incidents. An officer said with the recent abduction, there is a concern in South Kashmir where local personnel have been advised to keep a low profile. With snow melting in passes, infiltration bids going up, security forces are staring at a harsh summer ahead."

The four workers had entered the valley to hoodwink police officials and cross the police checkpoint located ahead on the Thane-Nashik district border.

The four migrant workers have been identified as Narendra Chaudhary, Bhupal Nisar, Rajesh Kaul and Fulvant Rawat. The workers are natives of Uttar Pradesh and worked as loaders in a warehouse for a major e-commerce company in Bhiwandi. The warehouse owner had not paid their salaries and had reportedly asked them to vacate the premises leaving them with no other option than to leave for their native homes.

The four decided to walk 1,500 kilometers to reach their homes and started walking on the Mumbai-Agra highway with their bags on their backs on Thursday. At around 10 pm, the four reached Kasara and saw a police checkpoint ahead. The migrant workers thought that the police might send them back or arrest them for violating the lockdown which is when they decided to cross the valley in order to bypass the checkpoint.

Soon after they stepped down into the valley, the four men found themselves stuck.

The deep gorge that they were stuck in had dense forest cover and it was pitch dark which prevented them from seeing anything even at an arm's length and with the use of their mobile phone flashlights.

Unable to locate the right direction, they kept going deeper inside the valley. Fearing that they might fall through a cliff or in some gorge, they waited at the spot for some time. However, the fear of snakes and scorpions forced them to alert emergency services.

One of the workers then called the control room (100) and sought help. A team of police personnel accompanied by a few locals then coordinated with the migrant workers and arrived at their location, said inspector Dattu Bhoye attached to the Kasara police station.

""There is dense foliage of trees and shrubs in the valley and it makes it very difficult to move and locate directions, the workers couldn't provide any clues so we asked them to switch on the Google location and share it with us. Based on that, we somehow reached them and rescued them at around 6 am on Friday,"" added Bhoye.

The rescue team handed the workers over to the Igatpuri police in the Nashik district. All four have now been placed under quarantine."

Cases have been lodged against 32 people, including two clerics, for gathering in mosques for offering prayers on Friday in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh breaching lockdown restrictions, police said.

An FIR has been lodged against 23 people including the maulvi of Dihwa village under Bondi police station area for offering Friday prayers in a group, Superintendent of Police Vipin Mishra said.

In another similar incident in Chauksahar village under Khairi Ghat police station area, maulvi Ramzan Ali led a group to offer prayers in a mosque and an FIR was lodged against nine people including the cleric, the SP said.

On Thursday, eight positive cases were reported from the district after which extra vigil is being maintained, Mishra said.

The district administration is continuously in contact with religious leaders and making appeals to people not to assemble for any religious or social programme.

The religious leaders have also been making similar appeals at the national, state and district level but people are coming out of their houses and trying to collect at places of religious importance and they have been warned of strict action if they try to break the lockdown, the SP warned."

In an announcement earlier, the district administration had decided to issue QR-coded passes for people in the district. For this purpose, hundreds of people were seen flouting social distancing norms outside the administration office.

This incident has come to light barely days after hundreds of locals in Madurai district gathered for the funeral of a Jallikattu bull. Local leaders such as RB Udhaykumar and Sellur Raju were also seen violating the rules of the lockdown in Madurai earlier this month.

The novel coronavirus has claimed 20 lives in Tamil Nadu to date, while over 700 patients who tested positive for the infection in the state, have recovered.

In a welcome move, various districts in Tamil Nadu have developed colour-coding systems for vehicles. This system allows the district administration to classify vehicles into essential and non-essential, even specifying days of the week when these vehicles can ply on the roads. However, recent incidents show that the state government must put a system in place for the application of passes for vehicles that adheres to social distancing norms and minimizes the risk of infection."

(Photo: India Today/Sujeet Jha)

The official driver and two police security guards of the BJP MLA, who had recently travelled to Kota during lockdown to bring back his daughter, have been suspended for accompanying the legislator without proper authority.

The Sub Divisional Officer, Sadar, Nawada, who had issued pass for inter-state travel to MLA Anil Singh, has already been put under suspension for negligence towards duty.

Driver Shiv Mangal Choudhary, who drove the Hisua MLA's car to Kota was suspended by the Bihar Assembly Secretariat o Thursday for not furnishing satisfactory reply to the show cause issued to him, officials in the secretariat said.

They said the driver was not supposed to take the vehicle, provided by the assembly office, outside the state without prior permission.

The two security personnel of the legislator- Shashi Kumar and Rajesh Kumar have also been suspended for dereliction of duty, Superintendent of Police Hari Prasath S said, adding they had gone out of the state without informing the authorities.

The MLA had on April 16 travelled to the Rajasthan town and returned with his 17-year-old daughter enrolled in a medical coaching centre there two days later.

The issue had given an ammunition to the opposition parties to attack Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who earlier disapproved various states making arrangements to ferry its students stranded during the coronavirus promoted nationwide lockdown in the coaching hub for the medical and engineering aspirants.

Singh, who happens to be chief whip of the BJP in the assembly, has said he undertook the arduous journey as his daughter was feeling depressedd at her accomodation following prolonged shutdown.

He had further said that besides being a public representative he was also a father and have duty towards the family.

In a statement, the Home Ministry said that violations of lockdown measures reported in some parts of the country pose a serious health hazard to public and may lead to the spread of Covid-19.

""The situation is especially serious in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat (Gujarat), Thane (Maharashtra), Hyderabad (Telangana), and Chennai (Tamil Nadu),"" the statement said.

The central government has already constituted 10 Interministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) for the spot assessment of the Covid-19 hotspot districts in the country.

Five of these teams are on inspection in Ahmedabad, Surat (both Gujarat), Thane (Maharashtra), Hyderabad (Telangana) and Chennai (Tamil Nadu).

The teams constituted earlier are in Mumbai, Pune (Maharashtra), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Jaipur (Rajasthan) and West Bengal (one team for Kolkata and adjoining districts and the other for North Bengal).

The Home Ministry said that in some of the districts in the country, a number of violations of the lockdown measures have been reported, posing a serious health hazard and risk for spread of Covid-19, which is against general interest of public.

""These violations include incidents ranging from violence on frontline healthcare professionals, attacks on police personnel, violations of social distancing norms in market places and opposition to setting up of quarantine centres and so on,"" it said.

The ministry said if such incidents are allowed to occur without any restraining measures in hotspot districts and emerging hotspots or even places where large outbreaks or clusters may be expected, it would pose a serious health hazard for the people of the country.

The IMCTs would use expertise of the central government and augment the states' efforts to fight and contain spread of Covid-19 effectively.

These teams would make an on-spot assessment of the situation and issue necessary directions to state authorities for its redressal and submit their report to central government in larger interest of general public, the ministry said.

The IMCTs would be focusing on a range of issues including compliance and implementation of lockdown measures as per guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act 2005, supply of essential commodities, social distancing in movement of people outside their homes, preparedness of health infrastructure, hospital facilities and sample statistics in the district.

Safety of health professionals, availability of test kits, PPEs, masks and other safety equipment; and conditions of the relief camps for labour and poor people will also be looked after by the IMCTs, the statement said."

The order made it clear that there will be no salary cut for those staff who earn less than Rs 20,000 per month.

The order also stated that ministers, MLAs, various Board members, Local body institution members, members of various commissions would receive 30 per cent less salary for one year.

Earlier, the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to deduct the salary for six days every month for the next five months.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier said government employees and their associated organisations have expressed their willingness to contribute one month's salary to the CMDRF.

Eleven migrant labourers of Murshidabad and Birbhum districts of West Bengal who had trekked all the way from Odisha were stopped by police around 200 km from their homes in Nadia district.

The migrant workers are now quarantined in a building in Haringhata block of Nadia.

However, while trudging over 500 km, the workers claimed they had not forgotten to put on masks and maintain social distancing.

The district authorities had given them an assurance after stopping them on Wednesday that transport would be provided to take them home, Superintendent of Police Ranaghat police district VSR Anantanag said.

But they were not sent home till Thursday evening.

When contacted, Nadia District Magistrate Vibhu Goel said, ""We cannot go beyond the lockdown guidelines. Those people went through thermal screening. But they have to stay in quarantine for the scheduled period as directed by medical experts.

""They came from another state. So we have placed them in a new and sanitised building at Nagarukhra in Haringhata, which is going to serve as a quarantine centre in Haringhata block.""

The elevn people, who worked as construction labourers at Badalpur in Puri district, were stopped by the police at Bara Jaguli under Haringhata police station on Wednesday.

After they ran out of cash, they had set out for their arduous journey on foot on April 11.

The group was stopped after having crossed over 500km. They were served food by locals and the police and were examined by doctors.

Raju Mondal, a resident of Jangipur in Murshidabad said, ""We used to work there on daily wage basis. None of the contractors took our responsibility. We waited for a few days but when we realised that the coronavirus-triggered lockdown would continue, we decided to walk home.

""We were also running out of money.""

The group trekked along NH 60 for some ten days and reached Kharagpur on the Bengal-Odisha border. From there, they took NH 6 to reach Dankuni in Hooghly, and then Durgapur Express way to reach Banshberia.

After that they crossed Iswar Gupta Setu and reached Kalyani in Nadia.

The police stopped them at Kalyani more and took them to Mohanpur Investigation Centre at Bara Jaguli.

With the little money that they had, the labourers bought puffed rice, biscuits and water en route.

""We walked at a stretch for long hours and sometimes took rest,"" Salwar Sheikh of Birbhum Rajgram said.

But they did not forget to take precautions. Saddam Seikh of Muraroi, Birbhum said, ""We put on masks and maintained social distancing even while walking""."

According to the Red Cross, people who have fully recovered from Covid-19 have antibodies in their plasma. These antibodies can attack the virus.

In line with the same sentiment, patients who have recovered from Covid-19 in various parts of India are now volunteering to donate their plasma. India Today spoke to Smriti Thakkar, the first Covid-19 patient from Ahmedabad who volunteered to donate her plasma to help those still fighting the infection.

The Gujarat government started its plasma transfusion treatment for critical Covid-19 patients after the Indian Council for Medical Research's approval. In plasma transfusion treatment, blood taken from a fully recovered Covid-19 patient is injected into a patient in order to help the patient's immune system generate antibodies.

Aged 23, Smriti Thakkar became Ahmedabad's first recovered Covid-19 patient who volunteered to donate her plasma. ""This plasma treatment won't affect the human body. It's really worth it to help Covid-19 patients,"" Thakkar told India Today.

Smriti returned from Paris on March 19 and experienced no symptoms of Covid-19 but was asked to quarantine herself at home as a precautionary measure. A few days later, she began showing symptoms and was found positive for Covid-19. After undergoing treatment at a local hospital for 15 days, Smriti has now recovered from the infection.

Another patient from Ahmedabad, Sumati Singh who also donated plasma said, ""This was my first blood plasma donation experience. My feelings were oscillating between nervousness and excitement."" Sumati added it was her desire to contribute in any way she could in the war against Covid-19.

Reportedly, six such donors had been identified and three of them had completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine period, following their recovery from the infection.

According to Gujarat Health Secretary Jayanti Ravi, one blood plasma donation can be used in the treatment of four Covid-19 patients. This technique is a viable option for the treatment of critical patients in the absence of drugs and vaccines."

Of these, 1,459 cases are active after the death of 75 patients and recovery of 105 others, Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra said in a video message.

""At present, the rate of doubling of cases in Ahmedabad is four days, which means that cases double every four days. If this rate continues, we will have 50,000 cases by May 15 and around 8 lakh by May 31,"" Nehra said.

""Our target is to bring down this rate to eight days. This will be a very difficult task because very few countries have achieved it,"" he said.

He added that the US and Europe currently have four days of doubling rate and only South Korea has achieved the eight-day rate.

""If we can slow down the doubling rate to eight days, our cases will be only 10,000 by May 15 instead of 50,000.

Similarly, the cases will be just 50,000 by May 31 instead of the estimated eight lakh. The way Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation is taking steps, we are confident of achieving this with the help of people's cooperation,"" said Nehra.

He stressed that the doubling rate must be brought down before the lockdown comes to an end on May 3.

""The holy month of Ramzan begins from April 25, it is a very sensitive month and several preparations have been made for it,"" Mumbai Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Pranay Ashok said. The DCP added, ""Since the holy month is overlapping with the Covid-19 lockdown, special zones have been defined and DCPs are taking extra precautions at the zonal level.""

DCP Pranay Ashok further urged residents not to gather in large numbers to buy food items. He also stated that the Mumbai Police is ensuring doorstep delivery of essential items to residents of containment areas with the help of NGOs and volunteers. ""We have interacted with community leaders and have sought their help to ensure that no one violates the lockdown,"" added Pranay Ashok.

In addition to the deployment of Special Forces, Mumbai Police will also be taking the help of drones to ensure that people do not gather on their terrace or move out of their homes for 'Iftaar'. These drones will also be used to locate large gatherings, if any, to ensure that the lockdown is not violated.

Meanwhile, the Mumbai Police have also clarified that a viral video showing a policeman telling people that they are allowed to move out of their homes for shopping during midnight and early morning, is false."

This comes after the visit of a five-member inter-ministerial team sent by the Centre. The team has asked the state government to increase quarantine facilities in Dharavi where tens of Covid-19 cases been reported.

Since the team's visit, 1,300 beds have been added to the institutional quarantine facilities in Dharavi. At present, the facility has 2,300 beds and 1,000 more are expected to be added soon.

MCGM is planning to add 75,000 beds across Mumbai in case there is a rise in Covid-19 cases. This will include quarantine facilities for slums and densely populate area and hospital beds for critical patients.

""It was observed that in slums containment is not possible due to common toilets. Hence quarantine facilities are being increased,"" a BMC official privy to the development told India Today TV.

Officials fear that if containment plans in Mumbai fail, the number of Covid-19 cases will increase. Keeping this in mind, the MCGM is planning to increase number of beds in hospitals and at quarantine facilities.

Under this plan, capacity of following hospitals will be increased: Seven Hills Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, GT Hospital, St George Hospital, Nair Hospital, HBT Trauma Centre, ESIS, Nanavati Hospital, Bombay Hospital, Wockhardt, Hiranandani Hospital, Raheja Hospital, Jaslok Hospital and Fortis.

With Agra not showing satisfactory sign of effective control over coronavirus spread, the Uttar Pradesh government sent a special team to the district for stock-taking. Now, the Lucknow team has submitted its report holding local administration for rising Covid-19 cases in Agra.

The special team, which comprised of Dr Vivek Kumar and Dr Suryakant from King George Medical University of Lucknow, found that that the principal of the SN Medical College, Dr G K Aneja chose the most inopportune time to go on a two-week leave citing eye problems. He proceeded on leave when novel coronavirus was rampaging through Agra.

Before he left, the principal chose to employ untrained staff in the care of Covid-19 patients which resulted in these staffers getting infected as well, the report said.

The team found that the principal did not take any interest in upgrading the college's pathology lab. This forced the authorities to send samples of all patients to KGMU in Lucknow for testing. This created an unnecessary delay in the investigation and diagnosis of Covid-19 cases.

On the part of the local administration, the team found that there was an undue delay in isolating the positive coronavirus patients, identifying their primary and secondary contacts, and quarantining them in time. Apart from that, the SN Medical College did not follow the WHO and ICMR guidelines, ignoring the protocol established for Active Quarantine and Passive Quarantine.

For the 23rd consecutive day, Agra found reported new cases of coronavirus infection. Eight fresh cases of Covid-19 were recorded on Friday morning, taking the total number of positive coronavirus cases to 335. Neighbouring Firozabad reported two new cases taking the Covid-19 tally to 64. Eight new Covid-19 cases were recorded in Mathura.

Agra District Magistrate Prabhu N Singh told India Today that out of the 335 infected patients, 56 percent are between 21-40 years of age. Compared to this, people in the high-risk age-group of 60-80 years were found to be least infected in Agra.

Out of the total coronavirus infected, 72 percent are men, while 28 percent are women. Over 27 per cent are in the age bracket of 40-60 years, 10 per cent under the age of 20 and less than seven per cent Covid-19 patients in Agra are aged 60-80 years."

(Photo: Saurabh Vaktania/India Today)

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been initiated in the Bombay High Court asking for judicial commission enquiry or an investigation under the supervision of a retired justice of the High Court in the Palghar lynching case.



Petitioner Aditya Mishra, a lawyer by profession, has filed the petition which also seeks “appropriate compensation to the victim’s family members or nearest kith and kin for the loss of life”.

Three people were lynched at Gadchinchle village in Maharashtra's Palghar district on the night of April 16. These three, according to police reports, were trying to cross the border to Gujarat during lockdown.

The villagers stopped the car as the area was infested with rumours about a gang of kidnappers and thieves. A mob of over a hundred then allegedly lynched the three. The three were rushed to hospital were declared dead on arrival.

110 people including 9 juveniles were arrested in the case while two policemen from local police station were suspended. The case has been transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) by the state government.

The PIL which will be argued by advocate Akshay Malviya also seeks that an FIR be registered against the 'errant police officers for their involvement in the offence who were present when the violent mob attacked the unarmed men'.

The PIL also puts an onus on the state intelligence department saying that it failed to identify that there were so many people who were guarding the area at night because of an unfounded rumour in the district. The intelligence department should have known about it and failed to take steps to prohibit instances as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the PIL said.

The PIL alleged that “the Palghar incident is not a sudden incident of killing. It is a conspiracy specifically against one sect and the costume or the outfit of the victim would have caused people to kill them.”

Videos of the incident had gone viral in which two victims can be seen wearing the outfits of sadhus while the third was their driver.

Earlier, an advocate from the Supreme Court, Alok Shrivastava, had filed a PIL seeking an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the case.

Many people had alleged that there was a communal angle to the mob lynching. To counter this, the Maharashtra government had released the names of all the accused to say that they are all Hindus just as the victims.

However, another writ petition filed by an advocate, Ghanshyam Upadhyay alleged that “many of the accused are “Hindus by birth” but many such persons are atheist by philosophy or are attracted to Naxalism and so cannot be given a clean chit in the case”. Calling it an extremely serious case, Upadhyay’s petition is seeking transfer of investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA)."

The 14-year-old big cat named Kalpana died around on Wednesday evening and the carcass was cremated on Thursday following direction to minimize human-animal interface, an official from the Environment Ministry said.

The tigress had grown frail. Post-mortem revealed high creatinine levels, the official said.

""Only a few officials remained present during cremation of the tiger carcass, in accordance with guidelines issued in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak,"" he said, adding, ""Samples have been sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, for coronavirus testing.""

Former member secretary of Central Zoo Authority DN Singh on Friday alleged lapses on the part of the zoo authorities.

""The tigress seems to have died due to dehydration. A senior veterinary officer from Jabalpur advised the zoo officials to administer saline through rectum, as it is easier to absorb in the body this way, but the zoo staff did not do it,"" Singh alleged.

""Also, no senior official was present when the animal was being cremated, which is in violation of the rules,"" he said."

(Photo: Getty Images)

The Chardham yatra is all set for a low-key opening this year with no pilgrims allowed to visit the Himalayan temples of Gangotri, Yamunotri and Kedarnath when their portals reopen in a few days after the six-month winter closure.

The opening ceremony of the four temples in Uttarakhand is an important annual event attended by thousands of pilgrims but the extended lockdown to halt the spread of coronavirus has cast its shadow on the yatra this year.

The Chardham yatra begins with the opening of Gangotri and Yamunotri temples on April 26 this year.

Kedarnath will open on April 29 while the opening of Badrinath has been put off to May 15.

""In compliance with social distancing norms, we cannot allow pilgrims as of now to visit the temples. Only a select group of priests who have to perform the pujas at the opening ceremony and temple committee officials are being allowed,"" state tourism and culture minister Satpal Maharaj said.

When asked how long it will take the state government to permit pilgrims to visit the temples, he said it will depend upon the guidelines from the Centre after the extended lockdown is over.

""Our priority at the moment is opening the portals of the temples in accordance with religious beliefs and traditions associated with them. The rest of the decisions will be taken as per the Centre's directives,"" Satpal told PTI.

With the spread of the virus dealing a blow to the yatra and tourism in general, he said an action plan is being drawn up on how to recover from the setback.

""We are mulling a number of steps to offset the economic impact of social distancing on the yatra which will continue even after the lockdown is lifted.

""One such step is shifting focus to 'Dhyan Kendras' and meditation caves near the temples where social distancing can happen automatically,"" he said.

He said his ministry is also studying the impact of the prolonged lockdown on international tourism and the steps being taken by different countries to overcome the effects.

""We will devise our recovery strategy accordingly. Our priority as of now is to open the temple gates,"" the minister said.

In a letter written to West Bengal Chief Secretary, Additional Secretary to the government of India Apurva Chandra on Friday sought a meeting with the Audit Committee to understand their methodology.

""The principal Secretary (Health) in his presentation on April 23, 2020, gave some reasons for the establishment of the committee of doctors and also mentioned that if a Covid-19 patient dies in a road accident, he/she cannot be said to have died of the infection. The IMCT did not find the reasoning convincing as there is no comparison between a road death and a death in a hospital due to disease,"" the letter states.

The central team has now sought the state government's order to constitute the Audit Committee along with case records of all Covid-19 patients where the cause of death is attributed to other reasons.

In order to scrutinize all such cases, the team has also sought records of the time that the Audit Committee took to conclude the reason of each death.

In his letter, Apurva Chandra has also asked the chief secretary whether any such Audit Committee exists in the state for any other disease and if such a committee was in line with the ICMR guidelines. The central team has therefore sought an immediate meeting with the Audit Committee in this regard.

Reacting to the developments, Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said the state was only following the Union Health Ministry's advice that an audit of casualties must be conducted and the system must be institutionalized."

At a review meeting with senior officers, Adityananth asked them to prepare a list of people stuck in other states and have completed 14-day quarantine there so that they can return home in a phased manner.

""Uttar Pradesh will bring back its labourers stuck in other states. The labourers who have completed 14-day quarantine there should be brought back in a phased manner,"" an official release quoted the chief minister as saying.

""The labourers, after being brought up to UP border by the states concerned after screening and testing, will be sent to their villages.

Those who have completed 14-day quarantine in the state should be sent home with ration and Rs 1,000, he said.

A decision has been taken to send two senior officers to districts which have 20 or more coronavirus cases. These officers will camp there for a week and ensure that lockdown is strictly followed, Adityanath said at the review meeting.

Stressing that spread of infections in hospitals and medical centres should be prevented, the chief minister said personal protective equipment kits, N-95 masks and sanitisers should be made available to check this.

He said that the ""identification of hotspots"" and policy regarding it is proving effective and this ""Uttar Pradesh model"" is becoming popular in the country.

""It should be ensured that public movement is totally restricted in hotspot areas and, only medical teams and sanitisation workers should visit,"" Adityanath said.

The Tablighi Jamaat members, who caused a sudden spike in the positive cases of coronavirus in the country, have become a headache for multiple states and intelligence agencies as hundreds of them are still missing.

An investigation by India Today TV has found that hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat members, who either attended the congregation at Markaz or came in contact with them, are still missing in various states. These missing Tablighis can cause another Covid-19 spurt in the country if they remain untraced and untested.

The Tablighi Jamaat members, who attended the congregation and visited the Markaz in the month of March, carried the virus to other parts of the country and infected many others.

The Centre and state governments have been trying to trace the Tablighis but even to date, hundreds of them remain untraceable in different states.

According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, over 4,291 positive cases have been linked to Tablighi Jamaat members in 23 states of the country. Over 40,000 have been quarantined at various facilities across states.

According to highly placed sources in various states, 40-50 Tablighi Jamaat members of those who came in contact with them are missing in Maharashtra, around 25 to 30 are untraceable in Uttar Pradesh, 20 to 30 being searched in Bihar, 20 to 25 in missing in Tamil Nadu and 15 to 20 are untraceable in Karnataka.

According to the government’s data, as on April 18, 2020, 84 per cent of positive cases in Tamil Nadu were attributed to Tablighi Jammat members, whereas 63 per cent positive cases had links with the Tablighi Jamaat members in the national capital. The Jamaat members contributed 59 per cent of Covid-19 positive cases in Uttar Pradesh, 61 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, 91 per cent in Assam and 83 per cent in Andaman and Nicobar.

India Today TV has learnt that the total number of missing Tablighi Jamaat members maybe around 200 in at least a dozen states and if they have been staying in contact with other persons, then the number may cross thousand. Looking at the seriousness, various states have now requested all missing members to come out and get them quarantined at the government facilities.

The initial list drawn up by the Delhi Police of Tablighis who attend the Markaz was around 1,587. A revised list was drawn up and the figure rose to around 2,100. This list was shared with all state police. The highest number of Tablighis as per this list was from Tamil Nadu.

To track down the missing Tablighis, who have switched off their phones, the state police have started tower mapping in which the state police are drawing up a list on the basis of the last known location of these numbers shared by Delhi Police. The police are also going through the call data record of the numbers. Local informants have also been activated by the police to find Tablighis who have been hiding. Community leaders have been roped in to convince masjid trustees to cooperate with the police.

Over 40,000 Tablighi members have been quarantined by the government in various states but the curious case of missing Tablighi members has become a serious headache for the central and state governments."

Out of these, 200 cases have come to light from the city's Dharavi area, also known as one of the most densely populated slums in Asia.

While addressing media outlets during the PIB briefing on April 24, Joint Secretary with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Punya Srivastava said that the use of community toilets in Dharavi has been identified as one of the factors that may have led to a sudden spike in the number of confirmed cases in the areas. Srivastava said that the findings of an inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) led officials to the role of community toilets in the spread of Covid-19.

""IMCT Mumbai team surveyed Mumbai's Dharavi, Govandi and Wadala slums. In Dharavi's containment zone, the team found that the use of community toilets leaves residents to defy the lockdown and step out of their homes,"" Punya Srivastava said. She further added that the team has urged concerned authorities to identify ideal locations and install portable toilets to reduce the use of community toilets in slum areas.

Punya Srivastava also said that the administration is dependent on home-quarantine in Dharavi which is why the IMCT has recommended the use of institutional quarantine for 2,000-3,000 residents of the area. ""Testing should be ramped up along with surveillance with the help of local volunteers in Dharavi and other slums,"" Srivastava added."

As many as 28 people were arrested for participating in a community panchayat to resolve a marriage dispute in violation of lockdown norms in Jalalabad town of Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district, police said on Friday.

Circle Officer Amit Saxena told reporters that a video had gone viral in which several people were seen participating in a community panchayat convened to resolve a marriage dispute that was in contravention of the restrictions.

A case was registered under Sections 188, 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act against 34 people with 28 of them arrested, he said.

The community panchayet was convened to resolve a marriage dispute and an order was passed for social boycott of Khurshid Qureshi who allegedly cancelled his son Javed's marriage fixed on April 22.

The marriage was apparently cancelled at the last moment as they could not get permission for the wedding ceremony during the lockdown. During the gathering, 34 people participated and the order was passed against Khurshid.

(File photo)

Authorities at the Delhi airport are working round the clock to devise strategies on how they would handle passengers once the airport becomes operational after the lockdown ends.

The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and GMR Group that run the Indira Gandhi International Airport say they are planning to deploy additional queue managers at kerb side (city side), check-in halls, security check areas and boarding gates. The idea is to maintain social distancing norms, they said.

Besides this, DIAL will also install auto-dispensing sanitisers at terminals.

""The Delhi airport is conducting training and assessments of key service personnel, run checks on major facilities, and performing risk evaluations to prepare for resuming operations,"" said Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO, DIAL.

For the past few weeks, the airport operator has been conducting deep cleaning every day and a team of 500 professionals has been deployed to carry out frequent disinfection drive in the premises after every hour.

While domestic and international scheduled passenger flights have been suspended since the start of the lockdown in March, the Delhi airport has been operational. Every day several cargo flights and flights evacuating foreign nationals operate out of the airport. This has meant regular movement of people (though considerably less in number) at the airport.

Keeping this in mind, the Delhi airport has been conducting regular sanitisation of high contact surfaces such as desks, chairs, elevators, railings, CUSS, trolleys, handles, trays and baggage belts inside the terminals.

DIAL said this practice will continue even after the airport reopens. Apart from these, washrooms will be closed after every hour to sanitise all surfaces.

Besides this, airport authorities will encourage passengers to wear facemasks and maintain social distancing at all times. To make social distancing more effective among passengers, DIAL has planned to put up visually impactful designs at various places.

Seating capacity in check-in area for passengers is also being increased. In order to avoid close contact and crowding at the counters, DIAL said it will encourage passengers to check-in at home or use self check-in facilities, self-bag tag, scan and fly services.

The Delhi airport also plans to install UV machines to sanitise checked baggage. For safety of passengers and staff, trolleys will be disinfected after each use.

The 52-year-old Dera chief's ailing mother Naseeb Kaur had filed the plea for parole on grounds of her illness, they said.

The parole application had been moved before the Sunaria jail superintendent recently.

It was rejected on the basis of inputs from the Superintendent of Police, Sirsa.

Official sources said that apprehension of breach of peace was the main ground for turning down the parole plea.

In June last year, the Dera Sacha Sauda chief had applied for a 42-day parole for farming in his fields in Sirsa. Later, he withdrew the application.

In August last year too, parole plea of the Dera Sacha Sauda chief had been rejected. At that time too, the dera chief had sought parole to attend to his ailing mother.

The plea was then found invalid by the Sunaria jail superintendent on the basis of a report of the Sirsa deputy commissioner, who took into account the security considerations, and the opinion of a board of doctors who examined the dera chief's mother.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted in two rape cases by a Panchkula court in August 2017."

The bodies of two suspected Covid-19 patients were left unattended for several hours, one of them for nearly 20 hours, in the isolation ward of a civic-run hospital in Andheri, Maharashtra, where other patients were present, sources said on Friday.

According to the sources, the hospital staff was not ready to wrap the bodies due to the fear of getting infected.

However, the hospital administration finally handed over the bodies to their relatives on Thursday around 4 pm, they said.

The incident took place at the Dr R N Cooper Municipal General Hospital.

""The hospital staff was not ready to wrap the bodies. One of the bodies kept lying unattended in the isolation ward for nearly 20 hours, while the other one for about 10 hours. Several other patients were present in the ward,"" the sources said.

Talking to PTI, the hospital administration claimed that the delay was mainly because the other staffers were not ready to help the attendant in wrapping the bodies as they were suspected corona-postive patients.

""The bodies of Covid-19 patients need to be wrapped properly, which a single person cannot do without the help of others. But the other staffers were not ready to help the attendant fearing that they might also contract the infection,"" Dr Pinakin Gujjar, dean of the hospital, said.

He clarified that there was no shortage of safety gear or material for wrapping the bodies.

The city has so far recorded 4,232 coronavirus positive cases. Till now, 168 patients have died due to the infection in the city.

The organisation has also asked police to ensure that pet shops are feeding animals regularly.

This comes following reports that some people have abandoned their pet dogs and cats fearing that they may get infected by keeping them at home.

PETA has written a letter to the Director Generals of Police of all state governments and Union Territories, urging them to direct police officers to book anyone found abandoning their pets.

In its letter, PETA said, ""There are concerns that pet shops and people who buy animals from them, are either neglecting or abandoning animals in their care.""

Recently, the World Organisation for Animal Health said that the current spread of Covid-19 is a result of human-to-human transmission.

""To date, there is no evidence that companion animals (pets) can spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare,"" the organisation said.

In its letter to the state police chiefs, PETA India pointed out that in a circular dated March 11, 2020, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has acknowledged that some people are abandoning their pets and urged law-enforcement authorities of states and Union Territories to take action against such offences.

On March 23, AWBI requested that law-enforcement authorities should ensure no animals suffer from hunger during the nationwide lockdown.

Meanwhile, PETA has also pointed out a recent order of the Karnataka high court directing district administrations to open all pet shops to ascertain the condition of animals and to provide them with food and any necessary medicine.

They are very, very small in size compared to their pathogenic cousins such as bacteria and fungi. They prey on almost any living organism. Some viruses infect other pathogens and make them sick. Bacteriophage is an excellent example. It infects and kills bacteria. Bacteriophage is considered as the reason why River Ganga water remained relatively bacteria-free before humans exceeded their capacity to keep the river water clean.

Coming back to viruses, they are so simple that most scientists don't even categorise them as living beings. Remember, school textbooks called them the link between the living and the non-living.

The novel coronavirus, scientifically named as SARS-CoV-2, is a comparatively large virus. Its size is about 120 nanometres - four times that of the poliovirus, which is just 30 nanometres. But a harmless Escherichia coli bacteria - the ones present in our gut - is some 16 times the size of the novel coronavirus. An average red blood cell in our body is about 64 times larger than the novel coronavirus.

The key molecule in all viruses including coronaviruses is protein. These are genetic materials and a storehouse of a very limited set of instructions - like a specific software programme. When these viruses get a favourable environment - namely, the body fluid - they start replicating themselves. This is their reproduction. They enter a cell and eat it from inside. When they leave the cell, they are in millions and the host cell is nothing more than garbage.

This is the way they wreak havoc among species including humans and crops. They are very smart and can travel through air, water, soil, droplets and from one person to other person. Through human-to-human transmission via saliva or mucous droplets, the novel coronavirus spread to all corners of the world after emerging from Wuhan in China. It took humans for a ride, literally.

Now, let's take a look at how the novel coronavirus behaves in our body. Proteins are crucial for the functioning of any living body. They don't only build muscles but they also establish the communication network within the body system. What is required, where and when, and how an issue inside the body is to be fixed is done by these proteins -- specifically, mRNA (messenger RNA), which perform the sentry's role in the body.

It is this variety of protein that keeps SARS-CoV-2 going. Typically, a human cell uses about 20,000 different types of proteins. Viruses use much less. For example, an HIV -- one that causes AIDS -- uses only 15 proteins to do its work. The novel coronavirus deploys 33, that too with the small size of its body.

Larger pathogens such as bacteria offer extra body space for medicines like antibiotics to block them from reproducing. The bacteria can be easily identified by antibiotics-induced antibodies as they flood outside the human cells. This behaviour makes them a suitable target for antibiotics/antibodies.

However, no antibiotic drug works on viruses because these germs don't reproduce on their own. They hijack the human host cell's physiology -- the miniature biological factory -- to make their Xerox copies. They leave one cell to invade millions others. They are always hidden. It is hard for medicine shots to kill viruses without damaging the body cells these pathogens have taken hostage.

There is another problem why treating viral diseases including Covid-19 is a bigger challenge. The viruses keep evolving almost continuously, but not significantly enough to be categorised as mutation. It is like changing clothes frequently.

This behaviour of virus confuses our immune system, whose responsibility is to detect the virus and neutralise the enemy. What happens often is that by the time the body's immune system detects the virus, the damage has already been done, and infection has transmitted to other person or persons.

Many a time, when body prepares for the fight with the invading virus -- the point when fever and other symptoms start showing up, the enemy is already on its way out after demolishing the fortresses of defence.

Doctors say the symptoms of fever etcetera are sometimes actually the response of the immune system rather than the virus. This is a stage where it may be too late for a patient. This is what is being seen in Covid-19 cases. A large number of Covid-19 patients died within 48 hours of their admission in a hospital. Those who were diagnosed earlier got well faster."

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh urged top military officials to initiate measures for limiting expenses and financial resources aiming to avoid wastage of any kind amid the economic burden imposed by Covid-19 pandemic.

In a video conference with military brass that included the three service chiefs on Friday, Rajnath Singh reviewed the operational and Covid-19 preparedness of the armed forces.

He expressed confidence that the forces will ensure operational preparedness while battling Covid-19 and the adversary will not be allowed to exploit the current situation.

This comes amid a series of ceasefire violations at the Line of Control (LoC) and increased infiltration attempts from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) even during the lockdown as the world fights the coronavirus outbreak.

""Stressing on the requirement of jointness of the armed forces, Raksha Mantri asked the Commanders in Chief to identify and prioritise tasks that could be accomplished quickly and assist in revival of the economy after the lockdown is lifted,"" the Ministry of Defence said in a statement.

Rajnath Singh reviewed the operational preparedness as well as measures to fight Covid-19 with all the Commanders in Chief through video conference, the defence ministry said.

The armed forces have been running quarantine facilities and also assisting civilian authorities in the fight against Covid-19.

The Defence Minister in his address, appreciated the role of the armed forces for the assistance extended to the local civilian administration and preparatory measures taken to fight Covid-19, the Ministry of Defence said.

During the conference, the Commanders in Chief appraised Rajnath Singh of various measures put in place by them to prevent the coronavirus infection among the forces and also about the assistance extended to the local civilian administration.

These include issuing of SoPs on Covid-19, introduction of appropriate modifications in protocols and drills as per the advisories issued by Ministry of Health and other agencies and taking care of the ex-servicemen and their families residing in their respective command areas.

The commanders appreciated recent devolution of emergency financial powers by the Ministry of Defence that has ensured timely procurement of necessary medical supplies, to bolster the health infrastructure of the hospitals."

I step out of my house every day with a firm resolve to serve the people in need. And my father is my biggest inspiration. He has been a police officer and I have seen him work throughout his life without any fear."" says Namrata Keen, a young pilot working for private carrier Spicejet.

Namrata, a Captain on Boeing 737 aircraft and currently flying a freighter aircraft, has commandeered 85 flights in the past three months, both domestic and international. A resident of Vadodara and operating out of New Delhi, this young pilot is a perfect example of how people engaged in essential services are standing firm in the line of duty without any fear.

Namrata told India Today, ""I am happy that I have this lifetime opportunity to serve my fellow Indians. The biggest concern, however, is when I return home. I always feel that I shouldn't be the reason for putting the lives of my family members at risk. And so, the safety of your family is one thing that always is on your mind.""

""I am lucky that my family has been very understanding. They realise that these are difficult times and we have a duty to perform. I would say that my family has always motivated me and never pulled me back. I am thankful for their support."" Adds Namrata.

As doctors, nurses, and policemen, the airline crew has also been working tirelessly on the frontline. Passenger flights have been suspended but the airlines have been utilising their aircraft for transporting essential cargo.

Arun Kashyap, VP and Head of Engineering Business Spicejet said that the carrier has flown over 450 cargo flights carrying over 3,500 tonnes of cargo the world over.

""Passenger aircraft are now being used to carry cargo on seats. DGCA has been very supportive. And we ferry fruits, vegetables, medical equipment, protective kits, etc. We have been flying the world over including Abu Dhabi, Shanghai, Hong-Kong, Colombo Kuwait, Singapore, etc. We are also proud of the crew because the company is running because of them and their safety is paramount."" Adds Kashyap.

Unfortunately, there have been multiple instances of the crew being discriminated against for being part of the aviation industry. When asked about this, Namrata Keen said, ""I have read about the various incidents that have happened with crew members of various airlines. I think it is extremely unfortunate that such things happen because they have only been doing their jobs with so much dedication and sincerity. It is very sad that such things have been happening with some."""

Satyathi urged the prime minister to issue a special notification to effect this.

Satyarthi is the initiator of an anti-child labour movement and has campaigned for deterrent laws against child labour in India and globally.

""It was an ideological and emotional dilemma in such an extraordinary situation. I am saying what I am feeling. They are all our children and our children must not die. We have failed in saving our children from child labour and exploitation, they must be saved from hunger and desperation. The life of every single child is above everything else,"" Satyarthi said in a statement.

The statement adds that the recent death of a 12-year-old girl, Jamlo Makdam, triggered ""deep anguish"" for Satyarthi. ""The desperate girl, while walking 150 kms, from a red chilli plantation in Telangana where she worked as a child labourer back to her village in Chhattisgarh died due to hunger just one hour short of her destination,"" the statement reads.

""The demand for a notification to give impunity to employers of child labourers for three months is the last thing that I would have ever thought in my life. Extraordinary situations call for extraordinary steps and I strongly feel that in order to save the lives of lakhs of children trapped in slavery and child labour across the country, this step is the only option left now,"" Satyarthi said.

""Earlier, they would not be paid their full wages and now they are not being provided food. The employers have fled to the safety of their own homes. These children, who work in factories located in Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi and other cities, were trafficked from different states and forced into labour. And now, even our activists are not being able to reach the children because of rules and regulations of the lockdown,"" Satyarthi asserted in his letter.

Urging the government to make proper provisions for food, safety, shelter and medical treatment for the children released during the lockdown, Satyarthi said that, if required, the help and assistance of local NGOs should be taken. Besides, he offered all possible support from his organization as well.

Seeking quick, timely and safe repatriation of the children once the lockdown is lifted, Satyarthi has also sought the constitution of an inter-ministerial task force to formulate and implement a strong action plan for combating the sudden spike in child trafficking once some semblance of normalcy is restored."

Soon after India ordered a lockdown of its 1.3 billion-strong population to combat the coronavirus in March, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ex-gratia payments of Rs 1,000 for nearly 30 million poor senior citizens, widows and disabled individuals.

But many disabled citizens say they haven't received this help yet.

""I have received nothing as yet from them,"" said Kiran Tatavat, who is from Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, and cannot walk.

Facing the same problem is Rashekar, a resident of Kalaburagi, a coronavirus hotspot in Karnataka.

""The government had announced that disabled people like me will get Rs 1,000 for three months,"" Rashekar said. ""It has not come as yet and we don't even know who to ask.""

""We are at home and cannot go out. How do we go about getting this money?” - Rashekar

""I cannot do anything as I cannot move,"" said Kamlabai Rathore, who is also from Kalaburagi.

""I had heard about the promised help during the lockdown, but none of that money has come to us. Please help disabled people like us,"" she pleaded.

LETTER TO P.M.

The National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), a non-profit, recently shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to look into difficulties faced by lakhs of disabled Indians.

The group asked for an increase in the ex-gratia amount -- from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 -- owing to a rise in the cost of food and medicines.

The NCPEDP got a response. ""But it is disheartening to see that there is hardly any assurance,"" said Arman Ali, the non-profit's executive director.

""It states that the guidelines have to be implemented by states but in that reply, there is no assurance of an economic package to help the disabled."" - Arman Ali

“The Rs 1,000 announced is for the entire three-month period which translates to Rs 333 per month for an individual. No one in the country has received the amount as yet,"" Ali said.

At first, there was no clarity on how the amount announced by the government would be disbursed, Ali said.

Later, it emerged that only those who registered with the employment exchange would get this amount, he said.

States hand out anything between Rs 500 to Rs 150 to disabled citizens unable to get a job despite registering with the government employment exchange.

This amount is generally disbursed bi-annually or annually.

“We have been engaging with the government and were told that the commissioner for disabilities in each state will be the nodal authority to deal with these and many such issues. But in many states these posts are vacant,"" Ali said.

LOCKDOWN PROBLEMS

Abhishek Kanika suffers from scoliosis, a curvature of the spine that has rendered him immobile.

Still, this Delhi resident has fought fiercely for his independence and does his work without help from others. The lockdown has affected him, but he, in turn, points to problems faced by his friends.

Friends needing medical attention found it tough to get passes for caregivers, owing to the ""complicated procedure"", he said.

Many passes were rejected, and even in cases where they weren't, caregivers had trouble reaching them in the absence of transportation, he said.

Many patients like Pune's Priya Vasvani, who has thalassemia major, are suffering without access to weekly blood transfusions and medicine during the lockdown. Many others don't have access to their doctors.

Priya Vasvani, a Pune microbiologist, has been suffering from thalassemia major (a blood disorder) for the last 24 years.

Now, for the first time, she's finding it difficult to find blood for transfusion.

""I have been dependent on blood transfusions all my life. But because of the present situation due to Covid-19, many thalassemia patients like me are suffering,"" she said.

""I would like to request the government to ask people to donate blood, and also, iron chelation medicine should be made available at every district.""

Troubles faced by the disabled in rural India are far greater.

Take Gobinda and Iswar Majumdar, who live in a remote village in Assam's Kamrup district.

Gobinda is deaf and blind, and his brother -- the family's breadwinner -- works in nearby houses to look after seven people.

But since the lockdown was enforced, Iswar has had no work.

There is no food at home. A local organisation is trying to help them, but it isn't enough.

""My brother has fallen ill, but I am not able to take him to the doctor. We have no money and no food at home either."" Iswar said.

""What do I do?""

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has formulated a standard operating procedure (SOP) for deployment of its troops at airports and the Delhi Metro once operations resume after the lockdown ends.

Director General of CISF Rajesh Ranjan said, ""The protocol has been developed to maintain speed, security and stability of both passengers and our personnel.""

The CISF will be soon submitting this SOP before the Union Home Ministry. Other stakeholders in this include the Urban Development Ministry and the Delhi Metro. In regards to the airports, the SOP has been shared with the Civil Aviation Ministry and BCAS.

Speaking to India Today TV, a senior CISF official confirmed that there is a proposal of making use of Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all commuters.

""Aarogya Setu app, with inbuilt e-pass feature, could be used for identification of suspected Covid-19 cases. People with high risks of spreading and contracting the infection should be discouraged from using the Delhi Metro,"" the CISF official said.

In order to maintain social distancing post the lockdown, only 25 people will be allowed to travel in a coach.

""We cannot allow overcrowding in coaches,"" the official said.

The CISF has 12,000 personnel who man the Delhi Metro and nearly 30,000 CISF personnel are deployed at 63 airports across the country.

""We will ask our staff to sanitise themselves every two hours and all people entering airport/Delhi Metro premises will be asked to mandatorily wear face masks. Hand sanitisation or washing facility will also be made available. This will include appropriate social distancing measures, sanitisation of gadgets and equipment, use of face masks, hand gloves, sanitisers and PPEs, wherever necessary, to safeguard and protect our personnel who are likely to be in close contact with large number of commuters,"" the official said.

The CISF is also taking stock of the quantity of face mask, hand gloves, alcohol based sanitisers, PPEs so that it has sufficient supplies for the next three months.

The tribunal said that while the Bio Medical Waste Rules deal with waste generated in dealing with infectious diseases, the coronavirus pandemic has presented further challenges in terms of capacity to scientifically dispose of generated waste.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the Chief Secretary of States and Union Territories to closely monitor the scientific storage, transport, handling, management and disposal of Covid-19 waste as its improper handling poses a grave threat rob environment and health of people.

""At the national level, let a high level task team of Ministry of Environment, Health, Urban Development, Jal Shakti, Defence and CPCB supervise the handling and scientific disposal of COVID-19 waste in accordance with the guidelines,"" the bench said.

It also directed the state Departments of Environment and pollution control boards to ensure compliance of Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 and furnish action take report to CPCB.

“Let CPCB take further steps and furnish a consolidated report to the NGT of the steps taken and

the ground status as on May 3, 2020. The report may be furnished by June 15,” it said.

The NGT further said that Covid-19 pandemic has affected number of people across the world and more than one and a half lakh people have died world over.

Disposal of Covid-19 waste in general bins so as to be part of municipal waste or unscientific handling sewage and other liquid waste without safeguards can also be hazardous, the tribunal said.

“There is a need to incorporate best practices in the light of further experience and new thoughts emerging from time to time, apart from continued supervision and monitoring, compiling data in an online format, use of electronic/digital manifest system to track and log COVID-19 waste, “ it said.

There is also need for creating awareness about the precautions and steps to be taken by all handlers and workers as well as citizens, the tribunal added.

The green panel had on Tuesday urged the State Pollution Control Board and Pollution Control Committee to put in serious efforts to mitigate the possible risk of unscientific disposal of the bio-medical waste arising out of the handling of the Covid-19 disease.

It had raked up the issue of gaps in compliance of the Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 which are applicable to the disposal of the bio-medical waste generated out handling the pandemic.

The CPCB on April 19 has issued revised guidelines for management of waste generated during the diagnostics and treatment of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients.

The slugfest between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar reached a new low with the Governor shooting off a 14-page letter on Friday morning. In his letter, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has accused Mamata Banerjee of having ""abjectly failed"" in combating the crisis emanating from the coronavirus pandemic.

He said it seems that the chief minister's entire strategy is aimed at ""deliberately diverting"" people's attention from her ""abject failure"".

This letter comes after he Governor wrote a five-page rebuttal to the chief minister on Thursday.

In his fresh salvo at Mamata Banerjee, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said it was time for the chief minister to ""shun politics"".

""I can figure out that your entire strategy is crafted to deliberately divert people's attention from your abject failure in combating and containing coronavirus in West Bengal. Your appeasement of the minority community was so explicit and awkward that as regards a question about the Nizamuddin Markaz incident by a journalist, your reaction was 'Do not ask communal questions'. This is most unfortunate and cannot be appreciated. You will appreciate that a perpetrator can never position as victim,"" the Governor said in his letter.

Requesting Mamata Banerjee to disable her ""political antenna"" and ""shun confrontationist approach"", Governor Dhankhar wrote: ""Ours is the only state where central teams whose only role is affirmative and in aid of the state, are made to face unwholesome scenario. In all other states, it was seamless. Your cover up 'mechanism' would lead to very painful results. Banning of mobile phones inside isolation wards is a case in point. Time to reveal the real picture so that our fight against the coronavirus (pandemic) may be enhanced and sharpened.""

Questioning the CM's action of addressing people on the streets of Kolkata for the past couple of days, Governor Dhankhar wrote: ""How sagacious is it for the CM to take mike and broom day after day in this grim situation. Real time action and effective governance are need of the hour - not theatrics or politickingAs an escape route you thought of being in your favourite pastime of being in 'accusatory mode' and take to streets. Let me indicate in times of such gigantic crisis 'street fighter approach' is counter-productive and has potential to spell disaster for the people.""

The Governor's response comes less than a day after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accused him of transgressing his jurisdiction.

""You appear to have forgotten that I am an elected Chief Minister of a proud Indian state. You also seem to have forgotten that you are nominated Governor,"" Mamata Banerjee had written to him in a five-page letter.

(Photo: Reuters)

In its battle against the spread of novel coronavirus, the Sikkim government has decided to close its borders for visiting tourists until October. The state government said this is a precautionary measure to prevent the virus from entering the small Himalayan state with a population of nearly seven lakh.

As of date, Sikkim is the only Indian state that has not reported any Covid-19 case so far. Besides it, Nagaland, which initially reported one Covid-19 case, now reports a zero figure because the lone patient was transferred to Assam.

While no Covid-19 case has been detected in Sikkim so far, the state needs to increase its low testing figures. Only 81 samples have been sent for Covid-19 testing from the state. All of them have tested negative.

Speaking to India Today TV, Sikkim Governor Ganga Prasad said, ""Sikkim will be closed for all tourist activities till October. We have to take this decision in the interest if our seven lakh people. We have also retained all migrant workers and we are providing them food and also paying them every day. We know we will need their help immediately after the lockdown is lifted.""

Speaking about the measures taken by the state government to prevent the virus from entering the state, Governor Ganga Prasad said, ""There were many students from Sikkim who were studying in China. They were all back in January itself. Following that, we closed our border and did not allow anyone in. Even the statewide lockdown was given a go ahead from March 17, which was before the Janata Curfew.""

He said the retuning students were kept in quarantine and were allowed to go home only after it was confirmed that they have not contracted Covid-19. ""We are working with the local administration along with central government,"" he said.

Both Minister of State ( MOS) Home G Kishen Reddy and DG AP Maheshwari addressed the officers via video conferencing.

The POP for any uniformed police force is a grand affair for the force, a moment of pride for the officer and his family. But in times of Covid-19, CRPF, the largest central armed police Force (CAPF) took a giant leap by conducting an E-Passing out Parade.

The Passing Out Parade was witnessed electronically through the web link shared with family and friends. Several users tuned in to watch the virtual ceremony, a first for the 81-year-old force.

Following the norms of social distancing, no parade and drills were conducted which are otherwise the centre of attraction of every Passing Out Parade.

CRPF PRO DIG Moses Dhinakaran said, ""The Oath of the constitution is mandatory to start service in the force. In these challenging times, the nation requires the service of these trained and enthusiastic officers. Also, please be assured that all preventive measures and social distancing are being followed in the ceremony.""

Addressing the gathering, the Minister complimented the cadets for their immaculate turnout and dedication with which they completed their training. He also congratulated and thanked the parents of the cadets. Several netizens lauded the effort of the force.

(PTI)

Five among the 126 people who were arrested in Bengaluru over an attack on health workers and police have now tested positive for coronavirus. Former Karnataka CM Kumaraswamy has hit out at the Yediyurappa government accusing the administration of mishandling the incident.

While the attack took place on April 19, in the subsequent days, 126 people were arrested over the violence in Ramanagara near Bengaluru. On Friday, Karnataka Deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan said five of those arrested have tested positive for coronavirus.

On April 19, police officials and health workers were visiting the minority-dominated Padarayanapura area in Ramanagara district near Bengaluru. The health workers were there to quarantine some people who were suspected to have contacted coronavirus.

A total of 126 people were arrested in connection with the attack in Padarayanapura on April 19 and all of them were lodged in the district jail in nearby Ramanagara after being remanded to judicial custody by court.

After screening all the inmates, five of them were found to have coronavirus.

Former Karnataka CM HD Kumaraswamy has attacked the government saying the BJP government has turned the green zone of Ramanagara into a red zone with this blunder.

Kumaraswamy has said, “The jailers and staff are panicking now. The state government was badly advised by ADGP officer.”

“Police staff from the jail are staying in a rented house in Ramanagara. The owners are now asking them to vacate the house after this incident,” the JDS leader has claimed.

Kumaraswamy has also threatened to launch a protest if all the inmates are not vacated from the jail by afternoon.

According to official data, the peak power demand during the day has reduced by 40-50 per cent, while the peak electricity demand during the night has reduced by around 20-30 per cent.

The higher reduction in the day's power demand is due to the closure of commercial and industrial establishments in the lockdown which has led to around 70-90 percent reduction of electricity demand in this segment, the officials said.

Since the Janta Curfew on March 22 which was followed by the nationwide lockdown, the city's peak power demand has reduced by up to 49 per cent in comparison with the peak electricity demand last year, the officials said.

""The reduction in the peak demand is basically due to reduction in industrial and commercial activities during the lockdown,"" a spokesperson of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) said.

However, the domestic load has experienced no impact during the lockdown.

""People are confined to their homes and using electric appliances. So, there is no impact on Delhi's domestic load, which is around 75 per cent of total power load. In fact, there is a slight increase in this category,"" a discom official said.

The power demand situation is expected to remain the same till the lockdown is in force. The demand is expected to rise with an increase in the temperature in summers, he said.

""Being in essential services, BSES is always geared-up to ensure quality and reliable power supply to its consumers. We are closely watching the evolving coronavirus situation in the national capital and taking all appropriate measures to ensure reliable power supply,"" a spokesperson of power discom BSES.

According to the officials, Delhi's peak power demand in March considerably declined, even before the lockdown was announced.

On March 15, the national capital's peak power demand was 3421 megawatt (MW) that sharply reduced by around 33 per cent on March 22 to 2294 MW.

The city's electricity demand was 4016 MW in March last year, while this year, it was 3775 MW, the officials said.

Since the lockdown, Delhi's highest peak power demand has been 2486 MW on March 25, 2020, they said.

Delhi's peak electricity demand in April last year was 5664 MW, while the peak demand till April 22 this year was 3169 MW -- reduced by 44 per cent.

With the lockdown expected to be eased out in a phased manner from May 3, the demand is expected to pick up (as per projections) in June and July, the officials said.

For May, the demand is expected to be reduced by about 15 per cent from the projected values if the lockdown is lifted. But if the lockdown gets extended, the average reduction in demand is expected to be around 43-45 per cent in comparison to last year's peak electricity demand during the month, the officials said.

In view of heatwave predictions, however, the average reduction in peak demand will fall to about 35 per cent in June and July, they added.

Andrew Sam Raja Pandian, the founder of a portal called SimpliCity, was taken into custody by RS Puram police for allegedly publishing content which criticised the government and the shortcomings faced by its healthcare professionals. The articles also alleged corruption by a few employees of a public distribution system (PDS) outlet.

Besides the founder, a journalist and a photographer of the portal were all also taken in custody for questioning and were let off later. However, the founder -- Andrew -- was arrested under Sections 188, 505 (i) of the IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.

The police made the arrest based on the complaint, against Andrew and his portal SimpliCity, filed by M Sundararajan, Assistant Commissioner (Personal). The FIR filed by the officer said that the portal was involved in spreading false information regarding the way the government healthcare department and the PDS employees were operating.

The portal made allegations against the PDS employees stating that they were stealing relief funds. ""These kinds of reports would demotivate the healthcare workers and PDS employees,"" the complaint stated.

Meanwhile, Andrew was produced before the magistrate on Thursday night and has been remanded in judicial custody.

The arrest of the portal member and their questioning has been criticised by the journalists' forum in Coimbatore and Tiruppur.

Actor Kamal Hassan condemned the arrest of the SimpliCity founder and urged the government to not ""obstruct"" media."" Arresting people who point out irregularities rather than correcting the mistakes is autocracy,"" Kamal Haasan said.

Umaji Chavan, a resident of Jagdalwadi village of Omerga tehsil, said the price offered by traders who buy these vegetables from farmers was so low that he was left with no option but to take the extreme step of razing the entire crop.

""I razed the entire cabbage field with the help of a tractor and a rotor,"" Chavan told PTI on Friday. Due to the ongoing lockdown - which is now over a month old in Maharashtra, where it was put in place before the national lockdown began - the demand, transport and sale of vegetables has become a big problem for farmers, he said.

""We tried to sell cabbage in the market at Omerga, which is 20 km away from my village. We were offered Rs 20 for 50 kg produce. The price I was offered is almost one-sixth of the normal selling price in the market,"" he said.

""I have spent almost Rs one lakh to cultivate the cabbage crop on the one-acre field. I expected a reasonable return on investment but had I sold the produce at the asking rate, I would not have got even one-fifth of the amount I put in,"" Chavan said.

""There are big markets like Solapur and Hyderabad, where I could have got a better price. But Solapur is 100 km from my village, and Hyderabad is 200 km away. Transportation to these cities amid lockdown is difficult,"" he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/odisha-west-bengal-migration-labourers-coronavirus-1670396-2020-04-24,24-04-2020 00:00,Covid-19: Decoding Odisha's crisis of migration of labourers from Bengal,"The migration of workers from West Bengal is proving to be a menace to Odisha in its battle against the Covid-19 crisis. Countrywide reverse migration risks the spread of the novel coronavirus in every state. In Odisha’s case, the migration of daily wage labourers from West Bengal is giving the state administration sleepless nights.

The migrant labourers from Odisha mainly work in Kolkata and nearby suburbs of West Bengal, bordering Odisha. They usually live in small dingy rooms with poor access to quality healthcare and other basic amenities.

Out of Six Covid-19 positive cases tested on Thursday in Odisha, four patients had a West Bengal Connection. In total, 36 cases out of 89 cases had also had West Bengal link making it a reason for concern. All 36 are either returnees from West Bengal or have come in contact with persons who returned from the neighboring state in the recent past.

Odisha Government on Monday raised concern over West Bengal returnees after it was disclosed above one-third of Covid-19 positive patients in Odisha had a connection to West Bengal.

India Today tried to decode the surge of Covid-19 cases in Odisha and its connection with the migration of labourers from Bengal.

The movement of labourers from Odisha to West Bengal is in existence since the colonial era. In its heyday, the quaint and densely populated Hooghly with the maximum concentration of jute mills thousands of workers from Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to West Bengal with its lucrative pay.

The district houses the 150-year-old Wellington jute mill set up in 1856, Hastings, Angus, and Victoria jute mills, paving way for the jute revolution which used to export jute to foreign markets as undivided Bengal produced half of the world’s jute.

After the partition of Bengal occurred, suddenly the raw jute growers in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) and manufacturers in West Bengal found themselves in two countries and industry was hit very hard. The industry provides livelihood to more than three lakh mill workers and more than four million families.

However, low and irregular wages, alleged exploitation of workers, and a host of other problems have led to the shutting down of some mills in the state. Since then, thousands of local labourers have either opted for menial work or migrated to other cities in the states in search of work.

West Bengal also has around 5.8 lakh out-bound migrants both seasonal as well as on a regular basis and on the other hand, have around 2.2 lakh in-bound migrants from other neighbouring states.

The fear of joblessness in the lockdown is compelling the migrants to return to their native places.

Odisha has 38 villages that share the border with Bengal. Of the 38 villages, 35 are in Balasore and rest in Mayurbhanj district. Although the roads and vast stretches of border area along West Bengal border are sealed and being patrolled by the police team as well as the local elected members and villagers, still the urge of the migrants to return home is indomitable.

The assurances of food and shelter by the respective state authorities have come late and the migrants are running out of patience with minimum resources left with them. Also, the comparatively cheaper healthcare of Odisha is another reason why the migrants want to return from Bengal.

Earlier, Odisha Police DGP Abhay reviewed the police deployment on the border areas in Balasore district. The DGP also visited the Laxannath inter-state check post and reviewed the police arrangement. He instructed officials to ensure that no one from West Bengal enters Odisha amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Former Balasore MP Rabindra Kumar Jena, who originally hails from the bordering Bhograi area of Balasore District, told India Today TV that it is a fact that there is severe problem in and around Kolkata with regard to covid-19. Consequently, there is apprehension in the minds of people, particularly the working-class residing in Kolkata. Some of them are trying to leave kolkata to bordering states like Odisha. Few positive cases in districts like Bhadrak, Jajpur are demonstrative of this fact.

The government of Odisha has taken several steps to control the spread of Covid-19 for which it continues to appear in Top-2 states of the country, including Kerala. The steps include sealing all border roads, waterways, etc.

""In spite of all the measures, certain infiltration can’t be entirely ruled out. There are about 80 plus villages in Balasore district alone which borders Bengal. In fact, the geography is such in several villages that part of the villages are in WB. In that case, it is humanly impossible to control infiltration. We as local leaders have our huge network in every village. Let us rise above political agenda, work hand in hand with the local administration, identity such sneakers at the village level and quarantine, for which all arrangements have been made under the direct instruction of CM Naveen Patnaik,"" Rabindra Kumar Jena said.

Union Minister Pratap Sarangi wrote a letter to Odisha CM Naveen Pattnaik raising concern on the growing anxiety of the people of Balasore and Mayurbhanj because of the continuous influx of people from West Bengal through the inter state border.

One Kolkata Based Banker from Odisha said, ""It is not necessary those people are carrying Covid-19 from Bengal. Since Bengal is densely populated, the labourers don’t have access to livelihood, there are chances of them getting affected in the lockdown.""

TS DGP Covid-19 control room immediately referred the matter to Kukatpally police. The matter was then taken over by the Inspector of Kukatpally police Lakshminarayana Reddy.

Reddy found out that the patient, Lalit Kumar, was suffering from appendix pain and needed immediate medical attention. As the patient did not have sufficient money for his medical expenses, Reddy got him admitted in a private hospital. Reddy also paid Rs 20,000 for the medical bills of the patient from his own pocket.

""I have just followed the orders of my commissioner of police VC Sajjanar, who in every meeting reminds us, that the life of every person living in the state is our responsibility, no matter where they hail from,"" Reddy said.

The Union Home Ministry on Thursday rejected the Punjab government's request for opening of liquor shops in the state during lockdown, officials said.

The request came after the Home Ministry made it clear in its consolidated revised guidelines that no liquor shop will be allowed to open anywhere in the country.

There was a request from the Punjab government to allow opening of the liquor shops in the state during lockdown but the ministry has turned down it, a home ministry official said.

In its guidelines for the lockdown, issued on April 15, the ministry said there should be strict ban on sale of liquor, gutka, tobacco during lockdown. Bars were also ordered to be shut.

Two states, Assam and Meghalaya, allowed opening of the liquor shops in the first phase of lockdown, which was from March 25 to April 14.

However, the liquor shops in the two Northeastern states were ordered to shut down from April 15."

""The SP leader, his wife Tanzeen and son Abdullah have been booked under false charges on the orders of the government. Their image is being tarnished by the BJP,"" Akhilesh Yadav alleged.

(Rep Image)

Striking a positive note on the Covid-19 situation in India, the Centre on Thursday said it has been able to slow down the infection rate to flatten the curve and minimise the spread during the period of the national lockdown which has entered the 30th day.

As the number of coronavirus cases inches towards 23,000, top officials of the union government and the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) said the situation is ""currently stable"" and the growth of the infections has been more or less linear and not exponential, adding the testing has also been ramped up consistently though it was not enough.

The lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in force since March 25 in a bid to halt the spread of the pandemic. It was extended on April 15 for another 19 days till May 3.

In another positive development, the officials said that despite a 24-fold increase in testing, the percentage of positive cases is not rising. The percentage of positive cases as a ratio of testing is more or less the same as that a month ago.

Responding to a question over the prospects of India reaching the peak infection rate by May 3, ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava said,"" The situation is currently going stable and you can even say that we have been able to flatten the curve. However, it is difficult to say if the peak will come. In epidemiology, the idea of slowing the spread of virus so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time is known as flattening the curve.

""During the 30 days of lockdown, we have been able to cut transmission, minimize spread and increase the doubling days of Covi-19. We have been able to consistently ramp up our testing and utilise our time preparing for the future in case the virus spreads further,"" Environment Secretary C K Mishra, the chairman of Empowered Group Two, told a daily media briefing on the Covid-19 situation in the country.

""The growth of coronavirus cases has been more or less linear, not exponential, this indicates that the strategies we adopted have succeeded in containing the infection to a particular level. Post-imposition of lockdown, while the number of new positive cases has increased by 16 times, testing increased by 24 times,"" Mishra said in his presentation.

Mishra said one crucial weapon the government employed during the 30-day lockdown period is RT-PCR test to ascertain if one has contracted the disease or not. RT-PCR, which is a nose and throat swab test, still remains the gold standard for Covid-19 testing.

As on March 23, nearly 15,000 tests were done across the country and by April 22 more than 5 lakh tests were conducted, which is about ""33 times in 30 days"", he said, adding, ""But we are conscious of the fact that this is not enough and we have to continuously ramp up testing in the country and we will do that.""

Mishra also said India has done better than a majority of developed countries with respect to the percentage of test cases yielding positive results.

""We need to evolve our strategy based on the current position... We seem to be doing well so far with our strategy which is intensely focused on areas where we see a lot of positivity and action happening. Our testing strategy has been focused, targeted and continues to expand,"" he said.

In its latest update, the union health ministry put the total number of cases at 21,700 after the infections recorded a jump of nearly 1,250 in the last 24 hours and the death toll at 686.

The ministry also said 4,325 people have so far recovered from the infection, which is about 20 per cent of the total cases, since the first case was detected in Kerala on January 30.

According to a PTI tally based on reports from the states, the total number of cases was 22,951 and there were 721 fatalities.

Of the 11 empowered groups formed to suggest measures to ramp up healthcare, put the economy back on track and reduce misery of people once the lockdown is lifted, Mishra is the chairman of Empowered Group Two tasked with coordinating availability of hospitals, isolation and quarantine facilities, disease surveillance, testing and critical care training.

Mishra also said that in the last one month, the number of dedicated hospitals for treating coronavirus patients has been increased 3.5 times and the number of isolation beds rose by 3.6 times.

Lav Agarwal, a Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry, said no new Covid-19 cases has been reported from 78 districts in the last 14 days.

Giving a rough comparison of testing figures with other countries in his presentation, Mishra said the US had done 5 lakh tests on March 26 and had found 80,000 cases to be positive, Italy had crossed the mark on March 31 and 1 lakh were found positive, the UK reached the stage on April 20 and found 1,20,000 positive cases while Turkey had done 5 lakh tests on April 16 and 80,000 were found to be infected.

""We are today at half-million mark, India had conducted around 5 Lakh tests as on April 22 and had around 20,000 cases. So if we do a worldwide comparison, we seem to be doing well so far with our strategy which is intensely focused on areas where we see a lot of positivity and action happening. Of course there are other countries like South Korea which has done better than this. Our testing strategy has been focused, targeted and continues to expand,"" said Mishra.

Talking about the preparedness in terms of infrastructure, the official said the number of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals has increased 3.5 times since last month and the number of isolation beds has increased by 3.6 times during the same period. These numbers are increasing continuously.

""Our first goal is to ensure lesser that number of people need to reach hospital,"" he said, highlighting the importance of social distancing and taking care of the vulnerable which includes the elderly and those with co-morbidities.

About 3,773 dedicated coronavirus hospitals, health centres and care centres with capacity of 1,94,026 isolation beds, 24,644 ICU beds and 12,371 ventilators have been readied across the country. ""This is augmented everyday,"" he said.

""So we want to create a structure where we test most people, treat them according to the need and then ensure we are able to cure them and save lives,"" Mishra asserted.

The central government on Thursday said that the country has been able to control the transmission of the deadly novel coronavirus while increasing the recovery rate to almost 20 per cent. Even as the nation reported over 1200 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, the Centre said that India has nearly flattened the curve.

As per the Union Health Ministry data, India has so far reported 21,700 cases of novel coronavirus with 686 deaths.

The ministry also said 4,325 people have so far recovered from the infection, which is about 20 per cent of the total cases, since the first case was detected in Kerala on January 30.

As per the Centre, the country is prepared for any future outbreak of the disease as it has given a boost to medical facilities, ramped up testing and is better prepared to fight against the Covid-19 outbreak.

To boost the war chest, the Finance Ministry on Thursday decided to freeze dearness allowance and dearness relief of government employees and pensioners for January to July 2020 period.

However, as per a top financial editor, India will need a lot than Rs 1.2 lakh crore the DA and DR freeze will save up to fight what comes after the Covid outbreak,

Chief Editor of Financial Times Martin Wolf said that the Indian economy will take a massive hit as public debt will rise exponentially and that the country’s fiscal deficit levels could be stretched to the limit.

Meanwhile, the government has stepped up the search for Tablighi Jamaat chief, who has been accused of encouraging members of his organisation to gather and stay inside the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi despite the ongoing virus outbreak. The Markaz has been identified as one of the main hotspots of the virus with over one-third cases being linked to it.

Here are the top developments of the day on Coronavirus outbreak in India:

Are we about to flatten the curve

Striking a positive note on the Covid-19 situation in India, the Centre has said it has been able to slow down the infection rate to ""flatten the curve"" and minimise the spread during the period of the national lockdown which has entered the 30th day.

Three things in 30 days: What India achieved during lockdown

As India entered the 30th day of the nationwide lockdown, the Centre said the country has achieved a lot in its fight against novel coronavirus.

A member of one of the 11 Covid Empowered Groups set up by the Centre, CK Mishra told media on Thursday that India has done three key things in the last 30 days.

""All thanks to people of India, we have been able to cut transmission, minimise spread and increase the doubling time for Covid-19 cases,"" CK Mishra said.

""Second, we have ramped up testing and third, prepare for the future if the virus spread further,"" he said.

CK Mishra said that the country has been able to consistently ramp up our testing. ""We’ve taken several measures to ensure we remain more or less stable in the last 30 days,"" he said.

The top bureaucrat said that India has reached half a million Covid-19 tests. Even as he said that the number of tests India has conducted is 33 times since March 23, there has also been a spike in the number of positive cases.

""On March 23, we had done 14,915 tests across the country and on April 22, we have done more than 5 lakh tests. If a rough calculation is done it is about 33 times in 30 days. This is not enough and we need to ramp testing in this country,"" CK Mishra, Environment Secretary and Chairman of the Empowered Group-2 said.

Stigma adding Covid-19 death toll: AIIMS director

The stigmatisation of coronavirus patients is discouraging people from coming forward for testing at an early stage and a delay in treatment may lead to higher mortality, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said on Thursday, stressing that early diagnosis is the key to fight the deadly virus.

Stating that the primary treatment for Covid-19 is a supportive treatment in more than 80 per cent of the patients and oxygen therapy in around 15 per cent of patients along with other drugs, Guleria said convalescent plasma therapy is being used at various centres across the country in the treatment of coronavirus patients.

The doctor, however, said that Covid-19 is not a very deadly disease and 90-95 per cent of those infected can recover but a delay in treatment could lead to higher mortality among patients.

He described that patients are currently facing a lot of challenges and stigma which is not justified.

The majority of the patients who have recovered from Covid-19 are ""symbols of hope and victory"", he said, adding that stigmatisation was creating huge problems and panic in the society and these individuals and their families are facing hardships.

""This is not justified and it is actually causing increased morbidity and mortality,"" he said.

""Because of the stigma what is happening is that many patients who have Covid-19 or flu-like symptoms are not coming forward to healthcare facilities. They are coming very late when they are really breathless and this is leading to higher mortalities,"" he said.

""We need to reach out to those patients who are right now scared to come out because of panic and stigma that we attached to the disease and are not getting proper treatment,"" he said.

He appealed to everyone not to create an environment of fear and panic for such individuals who for an unfortunate reason got this infection.

FinMin freezes DA, DR

The government has frozen inflation-linked allowance for its 1.1 crore employees and pensioners, a move states are likely to replicate, helping save a combined Rs 1.2 lakh crore that could be used to combat the coronavirus crisis.

Last month, the government had announced a 4 per cent increase in dearness allowance (DA) for its 50 lakh employees and 61 lakh pensioners beginning January 1, 2020. This was to cost Rs 27,100 crore in the current financial year 2020-21.

However, central government employees and pensioners will continue to receive DA and DR, respectively, at the current rate -- 17 per cent -- till June 30, 2021.

Generally, DA for government employees and pensioners is revised twice a year in January and July in line with the inflation trend.

The combined savings of the Centre and states will be Rs 1.20 lakh crore, which will help in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and its fallout.

Maharashtra Minister tests positive

NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad has tested positive for Covid-19.

The 54-year-old legislator had admitted himself to a private hospital in Thane for a precautionary check-up.

Before that, he was under home quarantined along with 15 members of his family for a week as some of his security staff tested had positive for the novel coronavirus. It is suspected that the MLA came in contact with the virus after meeting a police officer, who later tested positive.

The MLA had tested negative for the virus before April 13.

Oxford starts human trial for vaccine

Human trials of an eagerly-awaited vaccine, developed by Oxford University, against the novel coronavirus began in the UK on Thursday, with scientists giving it an 80 per cent chance of success.

The vaccine being trialled is made from a harmless chimpanzee virus that has been genetically engineered to carry part of the coronavirus to be tested on volunteers aged between 18 and 55 who are in good health.

The trial for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 will be carried out through a collaboration between the Oxford Vaccine Group's clinical teams and the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute.

The time it would require to determine if the vaccine is effective would be ""heavily dependent"" on how much virus transmission there is in the community initially focussed on trial areas of Oxford and Southampton.

If there's very low virus transmission among the volunteers that are vaccinated, the would have to wait a long time to get the result, explains Professor Gilbert. Therefore, the healthcare workers in hospitals, most likely to have been exposed to Covid-19, will be among the focus groups.

Meanwhile, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine manufacture is already being scaled up in preparation for larger trials.

The optimistic time-frame being looked at for around a million doses is by September. Deals have been done with the UK and overseas manufacturers to make the vaccine at scale, should it prove effective.

IMF prediction on global growth optimistic, says top financial editor

International Monetary Fund’s estimate about the global growth is optimistic and it could be twice as bad for developed economies, a top financial editor on Thursday said.

Speaking to India Today TV News Director Rahul Kanwal, the Chief Editor of Financial Times Martin Wolf said such predictions may not materialise unless the Covid-19 pandemic is dealt with effectively.

Wolf’s comments came during a session of the India Today E-Conclave Corona series.

When asked whether IMF’s estimate on the world’s economic growth projection for FY21, he said it is optimistic and that the world will see a ""weak recovery"" if all goes well and the virus does not reemerge.

""Globally, until we have got the pandemic under control, the world economy will not go back to normal,"" Wolf said during the session.

""I think the best estimate is that we are going to have a weak recovery. If we open up lockdowns too soon we will have a W recovery,"" he said. A ‘W’ curve recovery could be a possibility if the virus reemerges after companies around the globe resume operations.

That could lead to further economic pressure as the world would go through another period of economic depression before final recovery.

""This year will be terrible, could be twice as bad as the IMF has predicted. After that, there could be very strong recovery if the situation improves,"" he said.

Watch: Top editor Martin Wolf on how to survive the Great Shutdown

Explaining why he felt IMF’s estimate on global growth was optimistic, he said there will be wide-scale uncertainty once the world opens up after the pandemic is contained. He said governments may put tighter restrictions on travel and other activities, which will lead to a weaker recovery.

He added that protectionism could also witness a rise in the post-pandemic landscape.

In India’s case, Wolf said there are many challenges for a country like India, where a large part of the population has lost jobs in the wake of Covid-19 lockdown.

Wolf said the decision to lock down key economic activities during the pandemic is fair, given the situation but added that the Indian economy will take a massive hit as public debt will rise exponentially and that the country’s fiscal deficit levels could be stretched to the limit.

But the top business commentator feels that the Indian government has to solely focus on saving the livelihoods of the people and companies in order to effectively restart the economy when the situation improves.

MHA rejects Punjab govt's request to reopen liquor stores

The Union Home Ministry has rejected the Punjab government's request for opening of liquor shops in the state during lockdown, officials said.

The request came after the Home Ministry made it clear in its consolidated revised guidelines that no liquor shop will be allowed to open anywhere in the country.

There was a request from the Punjab government to allow opening of the liquor shops in the state during lockdown but the ministry has turned down it, a senior Home Ministry official said.

In its guidelines for the lockdown, issued on April 15, the ministry said there should be strict ban on sale of liquor, gutka, tobacco during lockdown. Bars were also ordered to be shut.

Two states, Assam and Meghalaya, allowed opening of the liquor shops in the first phase of lockdown, which was from March 25 to April 14.

However, the liquor shops in the two Northeastern states were ordered to shut down from April 15.

UP farmhouse of Tablighi Jamaat leader raided

The Delhi Police’s Crime Branch on Thursday raided a farmhouse of Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhavli, who was booked for organising a religious congregation here in violation of Covid-19 lockdown orders.

The raid was carried out at Kandhavli’s farmhouse in Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district.

The cleric was booked along with seven others on a complaint at the city’s Nizamuddin police station for holding the congregation in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Several people who attended the event in March and travelled across the country tested positive for the coronavirus, and the Nizamuddin area where the gathering was held was declared a Covid-19 hotspot.

Fresh war of words between West Bengal CM and Governor

While the nation is pooling resources to battle novel coronavirus outbreak, the politics in Bengal is not coming to an end. On Thursday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had a fresh war of words.

Mamata Banerjee accused Jagdeep Dhankhar of repeatedly interfering in the functioning of the state administration, and asked him to judge who has ""crossed the limit of constitutional dharma and decency"" between the two constitutional functionaries.

Banerjee's letter comes in the backdrop of Dhankhar repeatedly voicing concern over the way the state government has been tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.

In a strongly worded letter to the governor, Banerjee said Dhankhar has forgotten that she is the ""elected chief minister of a proud Indian state"" whereas he is a nominated governor.

""You have to judge for yourself, whether your direct attacks on me, my ministers, officers, your tone, tenor and language, which in mildest words of extreme moderation, deserve to be characterized as parliamentary, your holding press conferences against the state government of which you are a governor, your repeated and consistent interference in the administration of my ministries make it clear as to who has flagrantly transgressed constitutional dharma...."" she wrote.

Banerjee claimed the governor's conduct does not conform to even basic norms of decency between constitutional functionaries.

Dhankhar was quick to respond, tweeting, ""A communication @MamataOfficial has been received. Outrageously factually wrong and constitutionally infirm. Recognised Non Resident Bengali Doctors have in an eye opener representation flagged concern? @MamataOfficial in COVID 19 battle. Worrisome issues flagged 1. Gross under-testing in West Bengal, and 2. Misreporting of data on the cause of death in Covid-19 patients,"" he said in an earlier tweet.

Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the TMC government over a number of issues since assuming charge in July last year.

The feisty leader, while referring to his text message and communications said the tone, tenor, and language was unprecedented.

Terming Dhankhar’s statement in the audiovisual media ""to warn her"" an ""unprecedented event"", Banerjee said, the governor continues to ignore all advice and inputs given by her and the council of ministers since his appointment.

""Your expostulation leaves me with no option but to release these letters in the public domain to leave it to the people of this state and of this nation to judge for themselves as to who has done what and who in breach of elementary norms of constitutional behavior,"" she said, annexing a two-page letter from Dhankhar where he had castigated her government."

“We are prostrating as a way of showing our respects to the medical community for the service that they are giving,” T Jayamoorthy told media persons after stepping out of the doctor’s cabin.

In a video of the incident, the MLA from Ariyankuppam can be seen folding his hands before bending over to prostrate as a mark of respect for the doctor. At the same time, the surprised doctor can be seen taking two steps back. The MLA then repeats the gesture and leaves the doctor’s cabin.

On Thursday, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy and a number of other ministers in his cabinet were tested for Covid-19 at the union territory’s assembly.

(Image for representation: PTI)

A baby born to a Covid-19 positive mother in Rajasthan's Nagaur also tested positive for the virus on Thursday. This has raised concerns over risks Covid-19 poses to pregnant mothers and infant.

The Rajasthan government has declared the Mahila hospital as a hospital dedicated to expecting mothers who are suspected of being infected with Covid-19, keeping in view the Ramganj area which has been the hotspot as there are a few thousand pregnant women in its vicinity.

The state government is following up on 120 pregnant women in Ramganj who showed symptoms of Covid-19 infection and of whom eight have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already ordered that all pregnant women in cluster or containment areas must be tested for Covid-19 even if they are asymptomatic.

However, experts are not sure how the infection and its treatment will impact the growth of the foetus and the newborn.

There are apprehensions that while the virus and its treatment may result in premature deliveries and miscarriages, the issues such as whether mother's milk or medicines to a newborn baby can transmit Covid-19 infection are still being debated."

The judgment was passed by Judge Anil Mishra, based on the findings of the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Ekka was found guilty under section 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and has been asked by the court to pay a fine of Rs 2 crore. Ekka was a former minister of rural development NREP, transport, panchayat raj and building construction in the cabinet of former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda from March 12, 2005, to December 19, 2008

If Ekka fails to pay a fine of Rs 2 crore levied on him, he will have to undergo additional imprisonment of one year. The ED has also secured an order to confiscate Ekka's properties worth Rs 22.38 crore which was earlier attached to the case by the probe agency. These properties are in the form of movable and immovable assets consisting of residential properties, lands, fixed deposits, balances in bank accounts, national savings certificates, kisan vikas patras, vehicles, rifles and pistols etc.

""These confiscated assets were held in the name of the accused, his family members and companies owned by him and his family,"" the ED said in a statement. ED had filed a chargesheet against Ekka for laundering over Rs 20 crore while misusing his position as a minister in the Jharkhand cabinet.

In the order, Judge Anil Mishra wrote, ""The efficiency in public service would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently, truthfully, honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post. The reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchangeably clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke.""

ED's investigations under PMLA was based on an FIR registered by the Vigilance Bureau, the government of Jharkhand, for misusing his official position and power as a public servant to acquire multiple movable and immovable properties. Later, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had also filed a case against Ekka."

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rajasthan-covid-19-phobia-hits-private-hospitals-even-after-govt-orders-to-treat-all-patients-1670343-2020-04-23,23-04-2020 00:00,Rajasthan: Covid-19 phobia hits private hospitals even after govt orders to treat all patients,"Now, the Rajasthan government has ordered private hospitals to not shun any non-coronavirus patient. (File photo: PTI)

The phobia that hospitals reserved for Covid-19 suspects and patients are unsafe for other patients, has led to a sharp decline in the number of IPDs and OPDs in both government and private hospitals.

The government has acquired beds in many private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment even though government hospitals are frontline places for it. This has made many normal patients shun the hospitals altogether.

The hassles of the ongoing lockdown have further discouraged people from going out for treatment.

A government circular in the initial stage of Covid-19 outbreak implied that private hospitals acquired for Covid-19 were to not accept any other patients. The private hospitals began to refuse patients, even those requiring emergency care and dialysis, and even when the decline in admissions and OPDs hit the private sector hard.

Now, the Rajasthan government has ordered private hospitals to not shun any non-coronavirus patient.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot warned the private hospitals that they must attend to the patients as usual and that government has only asked to defer non-emergency surgeries and procedures to reduce the load on OPDs and IPDs to keep beds and resources available for Covid-19 patients. Gehlot urged the private hospitals to rise to the occasion in this crisis.

""My hospital has never refused any patient any treatment. Rather, we are badly hit as most of us initially discouraged regular patients who in any case have been avoiding coming to hospitals reserved for Covid-19 treatment,"" says Dr Sandeep Bakshi, Chancellor of the Jaipur National University Institute of Medical Sciences and Research.

He said his 800-bed hospital used to have 80 per cent occupancy and 1,220 patients in OPD before Covid-19 orders came in. ""Now, it is working on negligible load as we have suffered a loss of Rs 4 crore in a month,"" he said.



His 500-bed are reserved for Covid-19 patients and suspects and he proposes to start Covid-19 testing in two weeks time.

Bakshi welcomes Gehlot's statement and said he has been now trying to publicise that his hospital welcomes all patients and have separate dedicated wards for Covid-19 isolation and quarantine which will not infect regular patients in any way.

""We are willing to share any load with government hospitals in this time of crisis,"" he added."

(Reuters)

South Asia's coronavirus infections have crossed 37,000, with more than half in India, official data showed on Thursday, complicating the task of governments looking to scale back lockdowns that have destroyed the livelihoods of millions.

Authorities in India sought this week to ease a stringent 40-day lockdown of the population of 1.3 billion by allowing farm and industrial activity in the least-affected rural areas.

But more than 1,400 new cases reported on Wednesday, for one of India's biggest single-day jumps in recent weeks, carried its tally to 21,392 infections.

""We have to remain focused in this fight, the effort is to stop the spread at any cost,"" said Satyendra Jain, the health minister of Delhi, one of India's top three virus hotspots.

""If we want end the lockdown, we have to bring down the number of red zones.""

PAKISTAN PM TESTS NEGATIVE

In neighbouring Pakistan, which has roughly half as many cases as India, Prime Minister Imran Khan tested negative for the virus, the information and broadcasting minister said.

Khan was tested after a meeting last week with the head of one of the country's biggest charity organisations, who later proved to have the virus.

""I am happy to report that his test is negative,"" said Firdous Ashiq Awan, the minister.

But concern is growing over Pakistan's move, in response to appeals from religious groups, to allow mosque gatherings during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, despite experts' warnings that they could fuel uncontrollable spread of the virus.

The fasting month is expected to begin on Friday.

Until now, South Asia, home to a fifth of the world's population, has suffered fewer infections in the pandemic than rich nations such as Britain, Spain and the United States.

But that could be the result of lower rates of testing that health experts believe may allow the virus to lurk undetected.

""We have repeatedly said there is no alternative to a testing, trace and quarantine programme,"" said Sonia Gandhi, the chief of India's main opposition Congress party.

""Unfortunately, testing still remains low and testing kits are still in short supply and of poor quality.""

Here are official government figures on the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia:



* India has reported 21,392 cases, including 681 deaths

* Pakistan has reported 10,513 cases, including 224 deaths

* Afghanistan has reported 1,176 cases, including 40 deaths

* Sri Lanka has reported 330 cases, including seven deaths

* Bangladesh has reported 3,772 cases, including 120 deaths

* Maldives has reported 34 cases and no deaths

* Nepal has reported 45 cases and no deaths

* Bhutan has reported six cases and no deaths

With no income and no savings, the workers claimed that they had no other option than to cover a distance of 1,700 kms on their bicycles.

With heavy bags and water bottles tied to their bicycles, the migrant workers left early morning. They told India Today that if they stay back, they would die of starvation.

""We all met and then decided to procure bicycles so that we could reach our native place, our homes. We will be travelling on these newly purchased cycles through the highway and two persons will travel on each cycle. The cycles have been purchased with what money we had left and now we plan to reach our homes cycling 1,700 kilometers,"" said Pintu. He used to work with local masons and small-time construction contractors in Thane and Mumbai.

The group which consists of around 20 workers has procured ten bicycles on which they would ride in turns while the second person would ride pillion with bags on his back. When asked how they managed to procure new bicycles, they refused to divulge any information. They only revealed that someone felt pity for their condition and helped them buy the cycles so that they could return home.

Another migrant worker, Akhil Prajapati told India Today, ""The government is not providing any help and we have no ration left with us now. We will use the highway to reach our native place in Gorakhpur. We see that this is the only way left to reach home.""

Akhil added, ""Our landlord has been pressurising us for the rent. Whatever money we had with us has been spent in all these days of lockdown and we now have no work. We work on daily wages and are also out of ration.""

Ganesh Prasad, who joined the group in Thane, said, ""I work on daily basis building roofs and laying tarpaulin sheets. We have no other option than to travel, so we have started on our cycles and will peddle 1700 kilometers till we reach home through the highway.""

After the incident at Bandra where thousands of migrant workers gathered in one place and sought permission to return to their native homes, the Maharashtra government had announced that they would take care of each and every migrant worker in the state. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had also appealed to the centre for special trains for migrant workers.

One can see scores of such migrant workers walking with their bags on their shoulders, some even with their kids on national highways like the Mumbai-Agra highway and the Mumbai Ahmedabad highway. They can be seen walking in the scorching heat, trying to return to their native homes located hundreds of kilometers away."

(Photo: PTI)

When social distancing means no social drinking, not even a convivial beer or glass of wine, and lockdown translates to no alcohol at all with bars and retail outlets firmly shut, spirits take a nose dive mild depression for some and outright despair for many others.

COVID-19 being the great equaliser, the nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25 and is set to go on till at least May 3, has been a sobering experience for millions of Indians in villages and cities going without their every day or occasional tipple.

While the once-in-a-while drinkers are missing saying 'cheers' as often as they'd like, there has been a surge in withdrawal cases. Those with problems of alcohol dependence are most seriously hit with no access to alcohol or de-addiction centres and support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous that help them cope with their addiction.

With all watering holes and liquor stores shut only stores selling essentials are open in the lockdown period -- even the affluent with bars stocked with premium gin, vodka and single malts are running low on stocks.

“I have maintained a good stock over the years I won’t tell you the quantity but it was more than enough. But then the lockdown and now the extension took all of us by surprise and for once even I am worried my booze stock will run dry,” said Amit Mahajan, a Delhi businessman.

Many, even among the affluent, are rationing their drinks and borrowing from others who might have some extra bottles stashed away.

According to a 2019 report by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS, 14.6 per cent of the population (between 10 and 75 year of age) in India consumes alcohol about “16 crore people” in total.

Of these, nearly one in five alcohol users suffer from alcohol dependence and need urgent treatment, said the report titled “Magnitude of Substance Use In India”.

A 38-year-old in Amritsar who said he had been an addict for 10 years and was undergoing therapy is among those most affected. The prolonged shutdown disrupted his therapy and the social isolation has exacerbated his problems.

“I got agitated without any trigger factor, couldn’t sleep for long and there was shivering too. I tried contacting my friends and some close family members, asking them if they could help me with a bottle or two but no one helped.

“Earlier, I was going through therapy Since I am showing what my doctor tells me are ‘withdrawal symptoms’ I have again been put on therapy,” he explained.

Ramesh Banerjee in Kolkata said all his stocks have dried up and he is on mild anti-depressants.

""I have been a alcoholic for last 20 years Right now I am having one pill a day so I can have sound sleep every night,"" Banerjee said.

There are tragic consequences too.

In Kerala, which has a per capita annual consumption of over eight litres, the highest in the country, at least nine people reportedly ended their lives.

The state government had directed the excise department to provide liquor to those with a prescription from a doctor. The move, which faced a backlash by doctors, was later put on hold by the Kerala High Court.

“The non-availability of alcohol can be an additional reason for stress and anxiety for a person suffering from withdrawal symptoms, but in that case what needs to be addressed is the possible dependence or addiction.

“Instead of considering alcohol as an essential, it would be more helpful if people with alcohol dependence seek psychiatric/therapeutic intervention,” said Ann Philipose, a psychologist.

In Tamil Nadu, three men died in Chengalpattu after consuming varnish mixed with water as they could not obtain alcohol from the government-owned local TASMAC outlet, closed due to the lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus. Before that, in Pudukottai district, three men died after they mixed soft drinks with after shave lotion in the hope of a high.

S Nambi, a Chennai-based psychiatrist, called for addressing the problem at the primary healthcare level before it assumes alarming proportions. ""The non-availability of alcohol all of a sudden will cause withdrawal symptoms. While craving and mild trembling can be seen in normal cases, nearly 15 percent will develop complicated withdrawal symptoms and tend to become irritable, go into delirium or experience severe anxiety or restlessness,"" he said.

Ajit Magdum, director of the Anvay De-addiction Centre in Navi Mumbai, said they have started counselling addicts over the phone.

“This lockdown is also an opportunity for parents and spouses of people suffering from addictions to engage in fruitful conversations and bring the addicts on the right track,” he said.

Some centres opened their doors for emergencies.

Disha Foundation in Bhubaneswar, for instance, had shut down its de-addiction centre but admitted a 30-year-old man, said Pratap Kumar Mohanty, who runs the centre. “Following a request from the private hospital we allowed his admission in our centre. The man, addicted to liquor as well as ganja, developed withdrawal symptoms marked by psychiatric problems as he was unable to get his supply due to the lockdown,” he said.

And sometimes, desperation knows no bounds.

From Hubbali in Karnataka came a report of chemists stopping the sale of chemical-based sanitisers after people, chasing a high, were found to be buying large amounts and drinking the liquid.

There have also been numerous reports from different parts of the countries of desperadoes breaking into liquor shops to steal whatever they could lay their hands on.

Those with time, tech and access to varied ingredients are taking the matter in their own hands.

So, during the March 22-28 week, “how to make alcohol at home” was a trending topic on search engine Google.

From homemade mead to wine fermented from rice, tipplers are trying it all to put an end to their sobriety period.

Producers and manufacturers are hoping for a quick end to the seemingly endless dry days.

The All India Brewers Association (AIBA) and the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) have written to various state governments and the Centre to allow beer and alcohol sales to resume with adequate safeguards incorporated.

According to AIBA, March-June accounts for 50 per cent of annual beer sales and that they have already lost over 25 per cent of sales for the year a loss of nearly Rs 15,000 crore.

“The beer sector is disproportionately impacted because this is season time for us and all of us are sitting on a lot of inventory that can expire,"" said Ankur Jain, founder CEO of Bira 91 and member of the board of directors AIBA.

The CIABC said in its letter that alcohol is one of the most important sources of revenue for state governments. By shutting down retail shops, states are depriving themselves of the tax revenues that are so vitally required in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

""... Alcohol compromises the body’s immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, people should minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the WHO has in an advisory."

The chief minister admitted that a majority of the cases recorded in Bihar are examples of an infected person passing on the virus to a number of unsuspecting persons.

In Bihar, one person infected with Covid-19 transmitted the disease to 23 others in Siwan and 17 others in Munger. There are similar examples in other districts which justify Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's emphasis on early detection of infection and ""breaking the chain"".

During a top-level review meeting on Thursday, the Bihar CM also asked the state administration to ensure that contact tracing of infected persons is done quickly, followed by isolation and quarantine of the contacts, based on their status. ""The tests must be conducted immediately so that the chain of active Covid-19 persons can be broken as soon as possible,"" said an order issued by the CM's office on Thursday.

Nitish Kumar has also directed officials to maintain a close vigil on hotspots and adjoining areas. He asked for effective sanitization of the areas adjoining containment zones to ensure that the spread of the infection is blocked.

""We have to understand the seriousness of the disease and follow the discipline of social distance,"" the chief minister said, adding that there was no need to panic. ""The need of the hour is to be cautious and follow the lockdown,"" Nitish Kumar said.

The Bihar Health Department has already deployed health workers tasked with door-to-door screening in all the 38 districts of the state. Those showing any flu-like symptoms will be put through the established process of quarantine and testing for Covid-19.

Bihar's healthcare workers have already visited over 65.61 lakh houses and screened just over 3.58 crore people. Of this, 2,254 persons have reported symptoms of fever with cough and their samples have been taken and sent for testing.

So far, the state of Bihar has reported 153 positive cases of Covid- 19. Out of these, 44 patients have recovered whereas 13,785 tests have been conducted by Thursday evening.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also discussed ideas with the state's top healthcare officials to expand the scope of door-to-door screening along the lines of polio campaign. Kumar said that door-to-door screening exercises should be prioritized and intensified in all districts. This will enable the medical teams to initiate appropriate treatment at the early stages by segregating the infected ones based on their symptoms."

The 54-year-old legislator had admitted himself to a private hospital in Thane for a precautionary check-up.

Before that, he was under home quarantined along with 15 members of his family for a week as some of his security staff tested had positive for the novel coronavirus. It is suspected that the MLA came in contact with the virus after meeting a police officer, who later tested positive.

The MLA had tested negative for the virus before April 13.

Long chain of transmission

NCP MLA from Mumbra-Kalwa constituency is part of a long chain of transmission in Mumbai. He is right in the middle of it.

It is suspected that Jitendra Awhad was infected with novel coronavirus after he met a senior police inspector of Mumbra police station earlier in April to discuss the lockdown and law and order situation. The police officer tested positive last week when he was on leave at his native town in Nashik.

The officer had carried out an operation to nab Tablighi Jamaat members in Mumbra and had apprehended 21 foreign nationals including 13 Bangladeshi and 8 Malaysian nationals after the news regarding the Delhi event of broke.

Initial tests of the apprehended Tablighi Jamaat members had come back negative. Thus, it was not clear where did the police officer get the infection but it is suspected that some Mumbra residents were infected and through them, the infection had passed on to the officer.

After the officer tested positive, Thane municipal corporation authorities tested over 100 people who had come in direct contact with the officer, which included Awhad, policemen from the station house, journalists and few others.

The initial report showed that two journalists from Thane, three policemen from Mumbra police station and 14 men associated with Awhad were infected and had to be hospitalised.

Over 90 per cent staff of the Mumbra police station was sent into home quarantine while staffers were pulled from other police stations and headquarters to be deployed at the police station.

Those in touch with Awhad and had tested positive included five of his police bodyguards, house helps, cook and some party workers.

NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad is also suspected of passing on the virus unknowingly to former MP and NCP leader from Thane, Anand Paranjape, who was in touch with him.

After a string of people testing positive around him, Jitendra Awhad had quarantined himself despite testing negative for the virus. A week later, on Tuesday, he checked himself in a hospital for precautionary check-up and was tested positive on Thursday."

To contain the outbreak, 150 areas in the capital city have been classified as containment zones by Kolkata's civic body.

West Bengal on Thursday recorded its biggest single-day spike with 58 new confirmed Covid-19 cases coming to light from across the state, a majority of them from Kolkata. At 953, the state also conducted its highest number of tests in a single day on April 23.

Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said that the total active Covid-19 cases in the state are now 334. The death toll remains static at 15 with no fresh deaths reported across the state in recent days.

""In North 24 Parganas and Howrah, we have managed to contain the situation majorly but Kolkata remains a challenge. We are taking all possible measures so that there is no further spread. We are contemplating special measures for Kolkata,"" West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha told media outlets on Thursday. Sinha added that Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) alone has about 150 containment zones. Howrah has 60-70 such zones while North 24 Parganas has 40 areas that have been classified as hotspots or containment zones.

West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said, ""There is a major concern around asymptomatic patients. It is difficult to identify them. Across the country, more than 70 per cent cases are asymptomatic. If the lockdown is withdrawn on May 4, then it will be a big challenge. With symptomatic patients, we are tracking them through mobile app, frontline healthcare workers and surveillance. It is difficult to track who is getting infected by whom."""

As the number of novel coronavirus patients continues to rise in the district, local representatives say the administration has not taken adequate steps to contain the viral infection.

Miffed at the lack of proper response by the local administration towards the growing threat of community transmission of Covid-19 in Agra, two MPS, nine MLAs, the Agra Mayor and 100 corporators have decided to open a united front against the administration, threatening to take the matter before Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma.

Today, these public representatives held a meeting in Agra circuit house and unanimously agreed that the Agra administration has so far, failed to bring the situation under control. They said most steps taken so far by the administration have been reactionary in nature, which has done more harm than good.

The representatives claimed that while people are finding it hard to purchase milk, the police are spilling it on roads. Packed milk is unavailable and the administration has prohibited sale of open milk.

The representatives alleged that vegetables are rotting in trucks because the administration is not allowing vendors to sell them.

Agra Mayor Naveen Jain said police are unable to track contacts of Covid-19 cases but are rather beating up innocent people who step out to buy food and vegetables.

The representatives said they will soon prepare a report about the city administration's poor preparedness and place it before the chief minister.

However, speaking to IndiaToday.in, Agra District Magistrate Prabhu N Singh said the administration is doing its best under the present circumstances.

He said packed milk is available in ample quantity across the city and people are able to purchase it.

""Numbers for home delivery of essential items are being published in newspapers every day so that people can get their requirements fulfilled without leaving their homes,"" he said.

Senior Superintendent of Police Bablu Kumar said the local police have formed 'Corona Fighters' group involving citizens in every police station area. Members of these groups will urge people to stay indoors during the lockdown.

""If any police personnel is seen harassing people, information about him/her should be sent to the police station concerned,"" he said.

Speaking about the month of Ramzan that starts from April 25, senior police and administrative officials said they have held meetings with local Muslim representatives where they urged them to offer prayers from within the confines of their homes.

They were assured that they will not face any difficulties during the holy month and the food items used for Sehri, Roza and Iftaar will be available in ample quantity throughout the month, the officials said.

Four of the new cases were reported from the high range Idukki district, two each from Kozhikode and Kottayam and one case each from Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, he said in his daily media briefing on the disease situation.

Kottayam, declared a green zone on Tuesday with no new cases in 14 days, has reported one case each in the past two days.

Two cases reported on Thursday had foreign travel history, four had returned from neighbouring states and others were contacts of those already infected, Vijayan said.

The total Covid-19 cases in the state was 447, Vijayan said adding 23,000 people were under observation, most of them under home quarantine.

(Photo: PTI)

The liquor stores and bars in Punjab have been shut down, but the booze lovers are still getting their regular supplies. Using social media, people in Punjab are easily able to find a local vendor or bar which is ready to sell the liquor through the backdoor.

A reality check done by the India Today TV revealed that shutters of most of the liquor shops were down but the supplies were being made in the dark using a small window.

Requesting anonymity some Zirakpur residents told that adequate supplies of liquor were available but at a higher price. The bottle of a popular brand that is priced at Rs 600 is being sold at Rs 1000.

Sources say this cannot be done without the connivance of the local police officials.

The problem is not limited to Zirakpur.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Pathankot police raided a godown in a village and found 325 boxes of illicit liquor.

Bathinda police have registered 60 cases of drug smuggling and have booked 91 persons between March 20 and April 12. Eighty-five out of a total 91 persons booked have been arrested. The city police have also arrested three cops, including one ASI on charges of selling heroine and poppy husk during the lockdown.

The police seized 686 bottles of illicit liquor, 722 gm of heroin, 60 kg of poppy husk, 3 gm of smack, 4,443 intoxicant pills, 70 litre of hooch and 640 gm of opium in Bathinda district alone.

State's revenue loss

The major part of Punjab's revenue comes from the taxes earned from liquor sales at vendors and bars. The state earns nearly Rs 6000 crore from the liquor. However, revenues worth Rs 500 to 700 crore are also wasted following the widespread smuggling from the neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.

Pointing to the critical fiscal situation of the state, the chief minister has sought the Centre’s permission to allow the sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up VAT and excise revenue.

""The Ministry of Home, GoI, should allow the state to make a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent Covid-19,"" CM Amarinder Singh said in a letter written to Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday.

Amarinder Singh said that liquor sale would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and health care measures to combat Covid-19 and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses.

The chief minister requested the home minister for early action while assuring him of the state's full and continued support in the efforts of the Government of India to overcome the present crisis by effectively managing and containing the Covid-19.

Punjab has also sought an interim compensation of Rs 3000 crore for April on account of Covid national disaster besides asking the Centre to release Rs 4400 as GST compensation."

The raid was carried out at Kandhavli's farmhouse in Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district, they said.

The cleric was booked along with seven others on a complaint at the city's Nizamuddin police station for holding the congregation in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Indian Penal Code section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) is among the sections they have been booked, and the complaint was lodged by the Nizamuddin Station House Officer.

Several people who attended the event in March and travelled across the country tested positive for the coronavirus, and the Nizamuddin area where the gathering was held was declared a Covid-19 hotspot.

Kandhavli, currently under home quarantine, in a statement onn Monday, urged the followers of the organisation to pray at home in the month of Ramzan.

""I request all, both in India and abroad, to strictly follow the guidelines and instructions of the local or national governments and till the time restrictions are in place and please observe prayers at home. And even in this, we should not invite people from outside,"" he said in the statement.

In an audio message released earlier this month, Kandhalvi had said he was exercising self-quarantine after several hundreds who visited the congregation at Nizamudddin Markaz tested positive for the coronavirus.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/lockdown-cuts-pm2-5-pm10-levels-by-half-in-delhi-cpcb-1670273-2020-04-23,23-04-2020 00:00,"Lockdown cuts PM2.5, PM10 levels by half in Delhi: CPCB","With very few vehicles on roads, only essential commercial units functioning due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown and a weather favourable for dispersion of pollutants, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 levels and 50 per cent depletion in PM10 concentrations in the national capital.

The apex pollution control body has analysed data from continuous ambient air quality monitoring network of 38 stations in Delhi between March 16 and April 15. Air quality trends have been studied in two phases -- pre-lockdown phase of March 16 to 21 and the lockdown phase from March 25 to April 15.

In its report, the CPCB said, ""Significant reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels observed. Overall, 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and 50 per cent reduction in PM10 concentration observed during the lockdown period.""

PM2.5 refers to particulate matter having diameter less than 2.5 micrometers which can enter the lungs and even the bloodstream.

The CPCB said reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 levels primarily indicate depletion in combustion and industrial sources of pollution which are common to both fractions of particulate matter.

Since 81 per cent of Delhi's nitrogen oxide comes from the transport sector, according to TERI Emission Inventory, 2018, restrictions on vehicular activity led to 56 per cent reduction in NO2 levels and over 37 per cent cut in carbon monoxide (CO) concentration during the lockdown period, compared to the pre-lockdown period, it said.

Due to restrictions on the transport sector and industrial operations, the two major sources of benzene emissions, a 47 per cent reduction in benzene level has been observed, the CPCB report stated.

""However, only 19 per cent reduction was seen in sulphur dioxide levels which may be due to the fact that over 70 per cent of Delhi's SO2 originates from power plants located around the national capital (as per TERI Emission Inventory, 2018) and power plants were operational during the lockdown period,"" it added.

Since most of the eateries and industries in Delhi have shifted from coal to other less polluting energy sources, power plants appear to be the most likely source of sulphur dioxide.

The CPCB also analysed data from 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi.

Anand Vihar recorded 62 per cent, 69 per cent and 72 per cent reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels respectively during the lockdown period, the report said, adding Vivek Vihar, which is near major traffic corridor GT Road, saw a 60 per cent reduction in NO2 levels.

In Dwarka Sector-8, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels depleted by 48 per cent, 61 per cent and 68 per cent respectively, while Okhla recorded a 72 per cent reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels, the CPCB said.

The apex pollution control body recorded 24 hourly average PM2.5 and PM10 levels within National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 20 and 15 days respectively in 22 days of the lockdown period. NO2 levels were 75 per cent less than their 24 hourly standard.

Twenty-four-hour averages of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 levels dropped as low as 24 microgrammes per cubic meter, 39 µg/m3, 15 µg/m3 and 10 µg/m3 respectively during the lockdown period, the report said.

A 27 per cent increase in PM2.5 level and a 65 per cent increase in PM10 concentration was observed in between April 7 to April 15 compared to the first two weeks of the lockdown -- March 25 to April 6.

However, the CPCB said, PM2.5 and PM10 levels were still lower by 39 per cent and 35 per cent respectively than pre-lockdown concentrations. This may primarily be attributed to change in meteorological conditions.

The onset of summers has led to dry and dusty conditions. A mild dust storm from the western part of the country and the gulf region hit Delhi on April 14-15 rapidly increasing PM10 levels in Delhi and NCR, the pollution control body said.

(File photo)

Following the footsteps of the central government that on Wednesday brought in an ordinance under which attacks on doctors and health workers can now invite a punishment of up to seven years in jail, the Karnataka government too has brought in a similar ordinance.

The ordinance brought in by the Karnataka government also includes provisions under which anyone who damages a public or private property will be made to pay twice the value of the damaged property as compensation or have his/her own property seized by the government.

The state government's ordinance says people who attack health workers can be jailed and also be made to pay fine. The ordinance was signed by Governor Vajubhai Vala on Wednesday.

The state government's ordinance comes in the backdrop of a series of attacks on Asha workers and medical staff in the state.

On Tuesday, 48 doctors and paramedics who had come in contact with a coronavirus patient were put in quarantine, severely hampering the functioning of the hospital which is one of the frontline hospitals for testing and treating COVID-19 patients in Uttar Pradesh.

A doctor in the department of surgery at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College hospital at Aligarh Muslim University tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh said.

According to the president of the hospital's Resident Doctors Association, Dr Hamza Malik, the junior doctor who has tested positive was ""in no way connected to the coronavirus isolation ward and had contracted the virus three days ago while performing surgery on a supposedly non-coronavirus patient"".

Officials said the patient from whom the surgeon contracted the virus was asymptomatic but it is now suspected that the patient has coronavirus and tests are being conducted to ascertain the same.

A hospital spokesperson told PTI that as a first step about 20 odd doctors and paramedics who had come in contact with the infected doctor are being quarantined.

The Resident Doctors Association has demanded that in view of Thursday's developments the hospital should be designated as a coronavirus-specific facility.

In a statement, Dr Malik said if there is no secure system for protecting doctors including regular supply of PPEs, then the junior doctors who are presently working ""without any concern for their own safety round the clock on the frontline will have no option but to stop work"".

He has demanded that issues related to problems of junior doctors should urgently be addressed so that the ""ongoing efforts of medical professionals do not go in vain"".

When contacted AMU spokesman Professor Shafay Kidwai told PTI, ""We are fully aware of the commendable role played by the medical fraternity including the junior doctors"".

He said the administration was addressing all their concerns but in the present circumstances it was not feasible to declare the hospital as a designated hospital just for coronavirus patients.

""This hospital is catering to patients from about half a dozen districts in western Uttar Pradesh and we simply cannot shut our doors to other serious patients. Treating only COVID-19 patients would have serious implications for overall health services,""

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

(Photo: Reuters)

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Photo: Reuters)

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Photo: Reuters)

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples.

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many.

Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Photo: Reuters)

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples.

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Photo: Reuters)

India's total number of coronavirus cases has risen to over 24,500*, a number that includes more than 5,000 people who have recovered: a heartening milestone.

But fatalities have risen to 775 -- a grim toll, but relatively smaller compared to numbers coming out of other large countries battling the pathogen like the United States, which leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first discovered in China but has rapidly swept across the world in a pandemic that has crippled economic activity and prompted the IMF to warn of a sharp fall in global growth.

Here are key takeaways from the updated central government data on India's coronavirus cases.

1. More than 18,600 cases are still active, meaning that the patients are yet to recover.

2. As many as 5,062 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation says four-fifths of all coronavirus patients get better without needed treatment at a hospital.

3. The current death toll of 775 translates to a fatality rate of around 3.16 per cent.

4. Maharashtra continues to lead Indian states and territories in total cases (6,817) and deaths (301).

5. Tamil Nadu has the highest number of recovered patients: more than 860.

6. With 127 fatalities from over 2,800 cases, Gujarat has the second-highest death toll in India, followed by Madhya Pradesh (92) and Delhi (53).

7. Some states in the Northeast have been spared high caseloads. For example, one person each has been infected in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; the Arunachal patient has recovered. Sikkim is yet to report a single case.

8. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep, are also yet to report cases.

9. The information above is based on an update provided at 8 am on Saturday, April 25.

10. Data provided by the health ministry may not reflect current figures in states. For these numbers, track our live blog.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

For the rest of the areas, the Centre has issued guidelines on Friday and they will be implemented, he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

""Those who have chronic hypertension, heart problems, diabetes and the elderlyif they can hold their breath for 30 seconds and those who are young for 1 minute, it means you do not have Covid-19, either symptomatic or asymptomatic,"" Ramdev claimed, adding that people can test themselves.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

For the rest of the areas, the Centre has issued guidelines on Friday and they will be implemented, he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples.

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

""Those who have chronic hypertension, heart problems, diabetes and the elderlyif they can hold their breath for 30 seconds and those who are young for 1 minute, it means you do not have Covid-19, either symptomatic or asymptomatic,"" Ramdev claimed, adding that people can test themselves.

For the rest of the areas, the Centre has issued guidelines on Friday and they will be implemented, he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

For the rest of the areas, the Centre has issued guidelines on Friday and they will be implemented, he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

According to the Union Health Ministry, as of Saturday morning, the total number of Covid-19 cases in India has reached over 24,500, of which 5,062 have recovered and 775 have died.

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ideal-ac-temperature-coronavirus-outbreak-1670929-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Coronavirus outbreak: What AC temperature should you maintain?,"Set your AC temperature between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius, keep your rooms ventilated and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

For the rest of the areas, the Centre has issued guidelines on Friday and they will be implemented, he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

That, in essence, is the expert advice shared this week by the central government on the use of air conditioners at home during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a recent news report.

Guidelines from the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) say recirculation of cool air by air conditioners ""must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust"", the report says.

Humidity can be maintained at a 40 per cent minimum with a water-filled pan, and rooms should be ventilated even if ACs are off, the guidelines say.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

(Image for representation: Reuters)

In the past fortnight, Mumbai's Dharavi area has emerged as a major hotspot of novel coronavirus cases. To prevent further spread of Covid-19 cases in one of the largest slums in the world, the state government has chalked out a three-fold strategy.

Speaking on this at a special session at e-Agenda Aaj Tak on Saturday, Maharashtra Health Minister Tajesh tope said the biggest challenge for the state government is to implement the lockdown strictly and contain the spread of novel coronavirus in densely populated areas like Dharavi.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government has decided to administer hydroxychloroquine to people who are quarantined in areas with a high number of Covid-19 cases.

Rajesh Tope said instead of putting people in home quarantine, the government has decided to out high-risk people in institutional quarantine. ""For this, we would use schools, colleges, hotels or any institute as required and arrange facilities,"" Tope said.

""We are also working on early detection because many times reports of infection come after the patient reaches a critical stage,"" he said.

Speaking about the Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Rajesh Tope said the number of cases are increasing in the state and the state government's objective is to reduce the doubling rate and death rate. ""The death rate has come down from seven to four,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said a decision on whether it should be extended or not will be taken during the Prime Minister's meeting with chief ministers.

He, however, expected that in areas where cases are not increasing, some form of activities can be started. ""I believe we will have some relief after May 3 in areas outside Mumbai and Pune,"" he said.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

As summer approaches, India is on an extended lockdown that began last month to battle the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen whose deadly march across the world has forced millions indoors and crippled economies.

India initially allowed its citizens only to step out for essentials. But it has since taken steps to partially reopen its economy, issuing guidelines allowing some non-essential businesses to operate.

The nationwide shutdown is currently scheduled to end on May 3.

As many as 775 people in India have died of the coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness known as Covid-19. The death toll is grim but relatively small compared to fatalities in other large nations like the U.S.

More than 5,000 of the 24,500 odd people in India who have, or have had the virus, have recovered.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.

A doctor at a Hyderabad hospital treating coronavirus patients says she was harassed and abused by the residents' association at the building where her brother lives, and denied entry.

This follows a series of reports of medical staff in India being harassed, attacked or even denied a proper burial during the coronavirus outbreak.

The central government this week approved an amendment punishing attacks on health workers with a maximum term of seven years.

The Hyderabad doctor -- an orthopaedic surgeon -- filed a police complaint on Friday evening.

It was a decision by residents to stop outsiders from entering the premises due to the coronavirus threat that led to the confrontation with the doctor, the police said.

The police have filed a case under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal intimidation and outraging a woman's modesty.

Members of the medical fraternity have informed Telangana's health minister, E Rajender, about the incident.

He said the state government is conducting 5,000 test every day and is now aiming at enhancing its capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per day.

Speaking at E-Agenda AajTak, Raghu Sharma said, ""When the first case of Covid-19 emerged in Rajasthan on March 2, we had no way to test the samples. We had to send the samples to the NIV lab in Pune. But today we are capable of conducting 5,000 test per day and are aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day soon.""

However, raising concerns about the accuracy of the rapid testing kits, he said, ""We had to close down rapid testing kits because it was proving to be ineffective and unreliable. The ICMR too has issued guidelines on this.""

He said the only option before India is to increase testing on a large scale.

Speaking about the nationwide lockdown, Raghu Sharma said that it has helped Rajasthan control the spread of novel coronavirus.

""State government started lockdown on March 22. No doubt, we have been able to control the number of infections. But now we need to also see what other problems are arising out of the lockdown, he said.

Speaking also at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Bihar cabinet minister Sanjay Jha said the sate too has increased its testing numbers and has so far conducted 15,000 tests.

""We are screening people door-to-door in hotspots. Of the 200 cases in Bihar, there have been instances of one or two people infecting many. For instance, a person who returned from Dubai infected about 36 people. The person was discharged yesterday, but other 36 are still admitted. Had people been more careful, things could have been better,"" he said.

Asked about the lockdown, he said whether the lockdown should be increased or not, will be decided in the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister TS Deo Singh said it is important that the lockdown is relaxed in a gradual manner and not in one go. ""The reality is coronavirus infection exists and in the coming time, it will increase. The asymptomatic cases are the main challenge before the country. The idea behind going for a lockdown was to buy some time so that health facilities could prepare for the health emergency. But, today there is fatigue,"" he said.

""Experts say the spike is yet to come. Lockdown alone will not help us control coronavirus. We need to come forward before the people in a transparent manner. We need to change our daily lifestyle wear mask, maintain social distancing, wash hands regularly and adopt other measures. We have to come out of the lockdown but it should end gradually,"" he said.

TS Deo Singh said, ""It is important that people should not be made to think that since the lockdown has ended, coronavirus too is finished. We have to educate people that coronavirus will stay with us for a long time and hence precautions must be taken even after the lockdown.""

(Representative Photo: PTI)

Experts around the globe agree that the only way to beat the coronavirus is to test, test and test.

In Rajasthan's Bhilwara, which was becoming a coronavirus hotspot, the state government closed the district borders and had everyone tested and aa a result no new cases have been detected there in days.

On the other hand, cases continue to rise in Ramganj in the desert state.

Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma talked about both the models in the e-Agenda Aaj Tak and explained how the state authorities were working.

On the ever-increasing cases in Ramganj, the health minister said, ""2.5 lakh people live in Ramganj. We have divided it into 30 clusters. So far, 630 clusters have been investigated, after which the situation is under control.""

Significantly in Ramganj, around 100 Covid-19 cases were reported within 48 hours which sparked a health scare.

So far, the total cases of coronavirus in Rajasthan have crossed 2,000 while 27 people have lost their lives.

BHILWARA MODEL

On the other hand, Bhilwara was the city where the highest number of cases were reported in Rajasthan initially.

However, the state government acted proactively and sealed the borders of Bhilwara. Screening and contact tracing was aggressively and mass awareness was spread.

The Rajasthan government's approach ensured that Bhilwara reported less than 30 cases and has had no new cases since then.

The Bhilwara model received high praise from all quarters with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urging the Centre to implement it nationwide.

However, the opposition has questioned that if the Bhilwara model is so successful, why it is not being replicated with the same results in other areas of Rajasthan.

Clearing the air on whether lockdown curbs will be relaxed in Delhi, Satyendar Jain said shops won't open in containment zones.

For the rest of the areas, the Centre has issued guidelines on Friday and they will be implemented, he said.

Meanwhile, Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta hospital, said the lockdown has indeed helped the country contain the spread of the virus.

The number of cases has been controlled and hotspots, where special action is needed, have been identified, he said.



Naresh Trehan further said that relaxing the lockdown gradually will provide doctors with data on how people are reacting so that further strategies can be figured out.



The lockdown must not end all at once and must be gradually opened up, but people need to cooperate, he said.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chinese-rapid-test-kit-suppliers-statements-coronavirus-1670896-2020-04-25,25-04-2020 00:00,Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese rapid test kit suppliers,"Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for Covid-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.

In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they follow strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as as well in their usages to get accurate results.

India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.

Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.

While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.

Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said:

""We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation.""

The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations.

""The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degree Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced,"" it said.

In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company has been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune.

""In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products.""

The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.

At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result. India has been facing severe shortage of testing kits in view of rising cases of the coronavirus.

Speaking at e-Agenda Aaj Tak, Dr Trehan said, “While the theoretical basis supporting the use of plasma therapy is quite sound, every medical theory has to be rigorously tested.”

His comments come a day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that some Covid-19 cases in Delhi were administered plasma therapy and the results are positive.

“We need to find the window [stage of illness] in which this plasma therapy can be used so that it will be most effective,” Dr Naresh Trehan said, adding that donors are likely to be willing to come forward to donate blood plasma to help other Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said six Covid-19 patients have been administered plasma therapy in Delhi so far. ""All of them were critical patients and results are very encouraging,"" he said.

Several states across the country have appealed to use plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The convalescent plasma therapy aims at using antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient to treat those critically affected by the virus. The therapy can also used to immunise those at a high risk of contracting the virus -- such as health workers, families of patients and other high-risk contacts.
